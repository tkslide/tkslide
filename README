TkS*LIDE Readme
===============
0. What does it mean?
TkS*LIDE = Snobol/Spitbol (S*L) Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in
TCL/Tk (Tk).

1. Why TkS*LIDE?
Because I like Snobol4. 
Because Snobol4 had no IDE[0] and no GUI capabilites.
Because not everybody likes vim.
Because users are lazy.
Because it's fun.

2. Philosophy
- Open source
With enough eyes all bugs are shallow. 

- Simple
A simple and elegant language deserves simple and elegant IDE.
It may lack some buzzword-compliant features but won't distract beginners
trying to learn SNOBOL4.

- Intuitive
Learn Snobol4, not the (mostly useless) features and (exotic) keybindings of
the IDE. One who wants to learn S4 had already contact with computers and other
software. 

- Portable
I'm UNIX man. I can work with Windows, but I definitely prefer Unices.  But
openess and portability is a part of a Unix mind too. Windows users are
punished enough with the pathetic excuse for operating system they (have to)
use.
Why should I deny them (easier) access to one of the most wonderful programming
languages?

- Configurable
Time spent on (re)configuration can be used more efficiently for learning.
Configure once, use many times.

- Free as in "free beer"
I received so much, I can give something away.

The basic idea of a simple, efficient, user-friendly IDE comes from the
DrScheme and its documentation. There is a very interesting paper on design
guidelines[1]

TkS*LIDE uses the ctext widget implemented by George Peter Staplin.
The search and replace box is based on a wiki.tcl.tk article by R. Suchenwirth


0. At least no usable (YMMV) one. I always wanted to test the M. Livnehs
(windows only :-( ) Snopad, but I couldn't start it. Well, I must admit, I
stole some of M.L. ideas ;-)
