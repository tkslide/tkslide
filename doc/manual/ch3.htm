<H2>Chapter 3 : STATEMENTS</H2>
<P>
            Each line of input to SNOBOL4 consists of a sequence of ASCII
          characters, terminated by a carriage return.
<P>
            Comment and control statements are always one line long.  However,
          a program statement may occupy several lines if necessary.
          A continuation mark (plus sign or period) is placed in the first
          column of the additional lines.
<H3><A NAME="3.1">3.1 COMMENT STATEMENTS</A></H3>
            An asterisk (*) in character position one denotes a comment
          card.  All text through the end-of-line is copied to the listing
          file, but is otherwise ignored by SNOBOL4.
<H3><A NAME="3.2">3.2 CONTROL STATEMENTS</A></H3>
            Control statements provide instructions to the SNOBOL4 compiler.
           They begin with a minus (-) in character position one.
          Controls may be specified in upper- or lower-case, regardless of
          the current state of case-folding.  Unrecognized controls are
          ignored.
<UL>
<LI><B>-CASE</B><P> n          Fold lower-case names to upper-case if n is
                     nonzero.  Treat upper- and lower-case names
                     as distinct if n is zero or absent.

<P>
<LI><B>-EJECT</B><P>           Start a new page on the listing file.

<P>
<LI><B>-LIST</B><P>            Equivalent to -LIST LEFT.

<P>
<LI><B>-LIST</B><P> LEFT       Turn on list output, produce statement numbers
                     at left end of line.

<P>
<LI><B>-LIST</B><P> RIGHT      Turn on list output, produce statement numbers
                     at right end of line.

<P>
<LI><B>-UNLIST</B><P>          Turn off list output.  Errors are not shown
                     on the screen.
</UL>
            SNOBOL4 defaults to -LIST LEFT and -CASE 1.
<H3><A NAME="3.3">3.3 PROGRAM STATEMENTS</A></H3>
            If a line is not a control or comment statement, it is considered
          SNOBOL4 program text.  A SNOBOL4 statement may have up to
          five components.  The general form of a statement is:
<PRE>
    LABEL  SUBJECT PATTERN = REPLACEMENT              :GOTO
</PRE>
            Statement elements are separated by blank or tab.
<P>
            Ignoring the LABEL and GOTO fields for a moment, the remaining
          elements may appear in various combinations to create different
          types of statements:
<DL>
<DT>
          <B>Evaluate expression:</B> SUBJECT
<DD>
            The expression comprising the subject is evaluated.  It may invoke
          primitive and program-defined functions.
<P>
<DT>
          <B>Assignment statement:</B> SUBJECT = REPLACEMENT
<DD>
            The value on the right is assigned to the variable on the left.
          If failure occurs when evaluating the subject or replacement components,
          the assignment does not occur.
<P>
<DT>
          <B>Pattern match:</B> SUBJECT PATTERN
<DD>
            The subject and pattern expressions are evaluated, and the
          specified pattern is applied to the subject string, producing
          success or failure.
<P>
<DT>
          <B>Pattern match with replacement:</B> SUBJECT PATTERN = REPLACEMENT
<DD>
            If the pattern match succeeds, the replacement expression is
          evaluated and replaces the portion of the subject matched.  Only
          the matched portion is replaced; characters adjacent to the
          matching substring are not disturbed.
<P>
            If the equal sign (=) is present but the replacement field is
          absent, the null string is assumed as the value of the replacement
          field.
</DL>
            The GOTO field provides two-way branching to test the success
          or failure of the preceding statement elements.
<H4>3.3.1 Label Field</H4>
            If a label is present, it must begin with the first character
          of the line.  Labels provide a name for the statement, and serve
          as the target for transfer of control from the GOTO field of any
          statement.  Labels must begin with a letter or digit, optionally
          followed by an arbitrary string of characters.  The label field
          is terminated by the character blank, tab, or semicolon.  If the
          first character of a line is blank or tab, the label field is
          absent.
<P>
            If case-folding is in effect, lower-case letters are converted
          to upper-case before defining the label.
<H4>3.3.2 Subject Field</H4>
            The subject field specifies the string which will be the subject
          of pattern matching.  It also specifies the left side of a
          simple assignment statement if pattern matching is absent.
<P>
            In an assignment statement, the subject must be a variable
          name, an unprotected keyword, or a field-reference function from
          a program-defined data type.  If a string is produced by evaluating
          an expression, the indirect ($) operator must be used to
          reference the underlying variable.
<P>
            If the subject appears in pattern matching without replacement,
          the subject must evaluate to a string.  The string is scanned
          left to right during the pattern match.  If the subject evaluates
          to an integer, it is automatically converted to a string.  If replacement
          is present, the same subject restrictions of assignment
          statements apply.  Thus, a literal string is a valid subject only
          if replacement is absent.
<P>
            If the expression comprising the subject contains the concatenation
          operator, the subject must be surrounded by parenthesis.
          This allows SNOBOL4 to distinguish concatenation blanks within
          the subject from the blank between subject and pattern.
<H4>3.3.3 Pattern Field</H4>
            The pattern may be a simple string, or a complex expression involving
          primitive pattern functions.  The pattern specifies one
          or more strings which are systematically searched for in the subject.
           The pattern match succeeds if a match is found, and fails
          otherwise.  The &amp;FULLSCAN keyword determines whether the search
          is exhaustive, or if heuristics will be applied to prevent futile
          match attempts.
<P>
            The pattern may assign various matching components to variables
          with the binary assignment operators dot and dollar sign (., $).
<H4>3.3.4 Replacement Field</H4>
            In an assignment statement, there are very few restrictions on
          the replacement field.  If the subject is an unprotected keyword,
          the replacement field must evaluate to an integer value.  If the
          subject is a variable, the replacement field is assigned directly
          to it, without type conversion.
<P>
            If there is pattern matching on the left side of the statement,
          the replacement field must evaluate to a string, so that it may
          be inserted into the matched portion of the subject string.
<P>
            Replacement occurs only if evaluation of the subject, pattern,
          and replacement succeed.  Primitive functions which return success
          or failure may be used in the replacement field as predicate
          functions.  Since they return the null string, they do not alter
          the replacement value.  However, their failure can prevent replacement
          from occurring, and can be tested in the GOTO field.
<H4>3.3.5 GOTO Field</H4>
            Statement execution normally proceeds sequentially from one
          statement to the next.  The GOTO field allows this flow to be altered
          by directing the SNOBOL4 system to continue execution elsewhere.
           The GOTO field is set off from the preceding statement
          elements by blank or tab, and colon (:).  It may assume three
          forms:  unconditional, conditional, and direct.
<P>
            The &quot;unconditional GOTO&quot; causes control to be transferred to
          the specified labeled statement.  The label is enclosed in parenthesis,
          and may be a name, or the result of evaluating an expression
          and applying the indirect operator ($).  Transfer is made to
          the labeled statement regardless of the success or failure outcome
          of the earlier parts of the statement.
<P>
            The &quot;conditional GOTO&quot; similarly specifies control transfer to
          a labeled statement, but it depends on the success or failure of
          the statement.  The letter S precedes the parenthesized label
          where control goes next if the statement succeeds.  The letter F
          specifies the branch to be taken if the statement fails.  For
          example:
<PRE>
    :S(LOOP)         Branches to label LOOP if the statement succeeds.

    :F(ERROR)        Branches to label ERROR if the statement fails.

    :S(OK) F(NOGO)   Branches to label OK on success, to NOGO on failure.

    :(AGAIN)         Unconditionally transfers control to label AGAIN.

    :($('VAR' N))    Branches to the label obtained by concatenating
                     the string 'VAR' with the value of variable N.
</PRE>
            The &quot;direct GOTO&quot; is used to branch to a block of code compiled
          with the CODE function.  If the code contains labels, a regular
          GOTO could branch to the label and begin execution in the code
          block.  The direct GOTO will branch to the start of the code
          block, labeled or not.  A direct GOTO is specified by placing in
          angle brackets the name of the variable which points to the code
          block.
<P>
            Direct GOTOs may be made conditional by preceding them with S
          or F.  They may also appear with regular GOTOs:
<PRE>
    VAR = CODE(string)         :S&lt;VAR&gt; F(COMPILE_ERROR)
</PRE>
            The lower-case letters &quot;s&quot; and &quot;f&quot; may be used interchangeably
          with &quot;S&quot; and &quot;F&quot;, regardless of case-folding.
<P>
            The GOTO field may appear on a line without any subject, pattern,
          and replacement.  The absent SNOBOL4 statement is assumed
          to have succeeded.
<H3><A NAME="3.4">3.4 CONTINUATION STATEMENTS</A></H3>
            A SNOBOL4 statement may be divided across several lines by
          placing a plus (+) or period (.) in character position one of the
          successive lines.  There is no limit to the number of continuation
          statements allowed.  The statement must be divided at a
          point where a blank or tab could appear as an operator or separator;
          it cannot be split in the middle of a name or quoted string.
<P>
            Very long strings may be entered on multiple lines, using the
          implicit blank between lines as a concatenation operator:
<PRE>
            LONG_STRING = &quot;This is an example of a very long &quot;
    +   &quot;string that wends its way across multiple continua&quot;
    +   &quot;tion statements.  There is an implicit blank at the &quot;
    +   &quot;beginning of each line that provides the concatenation&quot;
    +   &quot; operator between segments.&quot;
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="3.5">3.5 MULTIPLE STATEMENTS</A></H3>
            The semicolon character may be used to place several statements
          on one line.  Each semicolon terminates the current statement and
          behaves like a new &quot;column one&quot; for the statement which follows.
          Only program statements are permitted after the semicolon; control
          and continuation statements are not allowed.  Here are some
          examples:
<PRE>
    I = 1;     J = 2;      S PAT = 'HENRI'       :S(YES)
    I = 1;OUT  OUTPUT = A&lt;I&gt;  :F(END);  I = I + 1 :(OUT)
</PRE>
            Because of its poor readability, placing labels in the middle
          of a statement is strongly discouraged.
<P>
            As a language extension, Vanilla SNOBOL4 permits a comment
          statement after the semicolon.  This provides a simple device for
          end-of-line comments:
<PRE>
    PARA    NEXT = GETNEXT() :F(FRETURN) ;* Return if EOF
            IDENT(NEXT)      :S(RETURN)  ;* Return on empty line
            PARA = PARA NEXT :(PARA)     ;* Splice line
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="3.6">3.6 THE END STATEMENT</A></H3>
            The last statement in a program must be an END statement.  The
          word END appears in the label field, beginning in column one.
          Normally, it is the only word on the line:
<PRE>
            . . .
            OUTPUT = 'All done'
    END
</PRE>
            After reading the END statement, compilation ends, and execution
          begins immediately with the very first program statement.
          When the program is done, it should flow into the END statement,
          or use a GOTO to transfer to it.
<P>
            Occasionally, we would like to begin execution at other than
          the first statement.  If we place a statement label in the subject
          field of the END statement, execution will begin there.  For
          example, this statement will cause execution to begin at the
          statement labeled START:
<PRE>
    END     START
</PRE>
