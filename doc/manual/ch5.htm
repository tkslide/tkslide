<H2>Chapter 5 : KEYWORDS</H2>
<P>
            Keywords allow a program to communicate with SNOBOL4.  Their
          names are set apart from other variables by the unary operator
          ampersand (&amp;).  Protected keywords cannot be changed by a program,
          while unprotected keywords can.
<P>
            Several protected keywords can be traced using the TRACE function:
          &amp;ERRTYPE, &amp;FNCLEVEL, &amp;STCOUNT, and &amp;STFCOUNT.  Tracing occurs
          each time SNOBOL4 alters their value.  For example, tracing
          keyword &amp;STCOUNT produces a trace after every SNOBOL4 statement
          is executed.
<H3><A NAME="5.1">5.1 PROTECTED KEYWORDS</A></H3>
            Among these keywords are several which serve as read-only
          repositories of fundamental system patterns and values, such as
          &amp;ARB.  The nonkeyword form (ARB) may be changed by a program, and
          later restored to its original value by assigning it the corresponding
          keyword.
<UL>
<LI><B>&amp;ABORT</B><P>           The primitive pattern ABORT.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;ALPHABET</B><P>        String of 256 ASCII character values in ascending
                     order.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;ARB</B><P>             The primitive pattern ARB.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;BAL</B><P>             The primitive pattern BAL.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;ERRTEXT</B><P>         String containing most recent system generated
                     error text.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;ERRTYPE</B><P>         Integer code of the last execution error to occur.
                     This keyword may be traced with function TRACE().

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;FAIL</B><P>            The primitive pattern FAIL.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;FENCE</B><P>           The primitive pattern FENCE.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;FNCLEVEL</B><P>        Integer depth of program-defined function calls.
                     It is initially zero, and incremented by one for
                     each function call, and decremented for each
                     function return.  This keyword may be traced.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;LASTNO</B><P>          Integer statement number of the previous
                     statement executed.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;LCASE</B><P>           The 26 lower-case alphabetic letters.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;PARM</B><P>            The command string used to invoke SNOBOL4.
                     Begins with the blank following the word
                     SNOBOL4.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;REM</B><P>             The primitive pattern REM.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;RTNTYPE</B><P>         Contains a string describing the type of return
                     most recently made by a program-defined function,
                     either 'RETURN', 'FRETURN', or 'NRETURN'.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;STCOUNT</B><P>         Integer count of the number of statements
                     executed.  This keyword may be traced.  Since
                     integers are 16-bit quantities, executing
                     more than 32,767 statements will cause this
                     keyword to overflow.  No harm results, and
                     the keyword may still be traced, but its
                     value will be a large negative number.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;STFCOUNT</B><P>        Integer count of the number of statements
                     which failed.  This keyword may be traced.
                     The same overflow problem discussed for
                     &amp;STCOUNT occurs with this keyword.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;STNO</B><P>            Integer statement number of the current
                     statement being executed.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;SUCCEED</B><P>         The primitive pattern SUCCEED.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;UCASE</B><P>           The 26 upper-case alphabetic letters.
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="5.2">5.2 UNPROTECTED KEYWORDS</A></H3>
            These keywords may be set to integer values to modify SNOBOL4's
          behavior.
<UL>
<LI><B>&amp;ANCHOR</B><P>          Nonzero for anchored pattern match.  Initially
                     0, unanchored.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;CASE</B><P>            Zero to prevent case-folding during compilation
                     with the functions CODE and EVAL.  Initially
                     1, causing case-folding to occur.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;CODE</B><P>            The end-of-job code is an integer value in
                     the range 0 to 255 returned to the operating
                     system.  It can be tested with the DOS Batch
                     condition ERRORLEVEL.  Initially 0.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;DUMP</B><P>            Nonzero to list unprotected keywords and variables
                     with nonnull values at program termination.
                     A positive value causes the list to be sorted; negative
                     values leave them unsorted.  Initially 0.  The dump is
                     produced to I/O unit 6 (OUTPUT).

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;ERRLIMIT</B><P>        Determines the number of conditionally fatal
                     execution errors permitted before terminating
                     a program.  The Execution Error Messages section
                     of <A HREF="../tutorial/ch7.htm">Chapter 7 of the
                     companion tutorial</A>, &quot;System Messages,&quot; describes
                     the errors which are conditionally
                     fatal.  Initially 0, causing SNOBOL4 to stop
                     if any error occurs.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;FTRACE</B><P>          Nonzero value causes each call and return of
                     a program-defined function to be listed.
                     Decremented for each trace.  Initially 0.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;FULLSCAN</B><P>        Nonzero to disable pattern matching heuristics.
                     Initially 0, the quickscan mode of
                     pattern matching.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;INPUT</B><P>           Zero to disable all input.  When disabled,
                     using variable INPUT (or other input-associated
                     variables) does not read data from the
                     file.  Initially 1, input is enabled.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;MAXLNGTH</B><P>        Maximum string length.  Initially 5000, maximum
                     value is 32767.  Memory limitations in
                     Vanilla SNOBOL4 will limit actual strings to
                     a smaller size.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;OUTPUT</B><P>          Zero to disable all output.  When disabled,
                     assigning data to OUTPUT or SCREEN (or other
                     output-associated variables) does not write
                     data to the file.  Initially 1, output is enabled.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;STLIMIT</B><P>         The number of statements allowed to execute.
                     If positive, it is decremented for each
                     statement executed; execution terminates when
                     it reaches 0.  If negative, there is no
                     limit, and it is not decremented.  Initially
                     -1.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;TRACE</B><P>           Nonzero to permit tracing with the TRACE
                     function.  Initially 0, it is decremented for
                     each trace performed.

<P>
<LI><B>&amp;TRIM</B><P>            Nonzero to strip trailing blanks from lines
                     read from ASCII files.  This is faster than
                     using the TRIM function.  It does not strip
                     trailing tab characters.  Initially 0: blanks
                     are not removed and short records are blank
                     padded to the file's standard record length.
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="5.3">5.3 SPECIAL NAMES</A></H3>
            The following names have special meaning to SNOBOL4.  If casefolding
          is in effect, they may appear with any combination of
          upper- and lower-case letters.
<UL>
<LI><B>END</B><P>              This is a special label which denotes the last
                     statement of the user's program.  An optional
                     label may follow the word END (in the subject
                     field) to denote where program execution is to
                     begin.  A program should terminate execution by
                     transferring to label END.

<P>
<LI><B>FRETURN</B><P>          Transfer to this label to return from a
                     program-defined function with a failure
                     indication.

<P>
<LI><B>INPUT</B><P>            Variable associated with input from unit
                     number 5.

<P>
<LI><B>NRETURN</B><P>          Transfer to this label to return successfully
                     from a program-defined function by name,
                     rather than by value.  The function name
                     should be assigned a name result (usually
                     with the period (.) unary operator).  This
                     permits a function call to be the object of
                     an assignment operation.

<P>
<LI><B>OUTPUT</B><P>           Variable associated with output to unit
                     number 6.

<P>
<LI><B>RETURN</B><P>           Transfer to this label to return from a
                     program-defined function with a success
                     indication.  A value may be returned as
                     the function's result; simply assign it
                     to a variable with the same name as the
                     function before transferring to RETURN.
