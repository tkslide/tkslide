<H2>Chapter 6 : DATA TYPES AND CONVERSION</H2>
<P>
            Most other programming languages require the user to explicitly
          declare the type of data to be stored in a variable.  In SNOBOL4,
          any variable may contain any data type.  Furthermore, the variable's
          type may be freely altered during program execution.
          SNOBOL4 remembers what kind of data is in each variable.
<H3><A NAME="6.1">6.1 DATA TYPE NAMES</A></H3>
            The formal name of a data type is specified by an upper-case
          string (or lower-case if case-folding is in effect), such as
          'INTEGER', or 'ARRAY'.  It is used with the CONVERT function to
          specify the data type conversion desired.  The formal name is
          also the string returned when the DATATYPE() function is used to
          determine an object's type.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>ARRAY</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                           N-dimensional array
<P>
          The primitive function ARRAY() creates an array storage area, and
          returns a pointer with this data type.  If this pointer is stored
          in a variable, the variable is said to be of type ARRAY, and may
          then be subscripted to access the elements of the array.
<P>
<LI><B>CODE</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                            Compiled SNOBOL4 code
<P>
          The primitive function CODE() compiles a string containing
          SNOBOL4 statements, and returns a pointer to the resulting object
          code block.  If this pointer is stored in a variable, the variable
          is said to be of type CODE.  The variable may then be used
          with a direct GOTO by enclosing it in angle brackets.
<P>
<LI><B>EXPRESSION</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      Unevaluated expression
<P>
          When the unevaluated expression operator (*) is applied to an expression,
          the result has the data type EXPRESSION.  Such expressions
          are not evaluated when they are defined, only when they are
          referenced.
<PRE>
    E = *(LEN(K) POS(M))
</PRE>
          defines E as an unevaluated expression.  When this statement is
          executed, the code to concatenate two function calls is compiled,
          but not executed.  It is only when E is referenced in a subsequent
          pattern match or appears as the argument of the EVAL
          function that the code is executed to produce a pattern.
<P>
            The unevaluated expression operator must be at the outermost
          level to create an object of type EXPRESSION.  If buried with the
          expression, the execution results may appear to be similar, but
          the object's data type is different.  That is, the two statements
<PRE>
    P = *LEN(N)
    P = LEN(*N)
</PRE>
          produce identical results when P is used in a pattern match (if
          LEN is not redefined).  However, the first statement produces P
          as type EXPRESSION, while the second produces P as type PATTERN.
          Expressions may also be produced explicitly with the CONVERT()
          function (see below).
<P>
<LI><B>EXTERNAL</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                        Created by external function
<P>
          External assembly language functions may create new data types
          whose structure is known only to them.  This feature is only
          available in SNOBOL4+, Catspaw's enhanced implementation of the
          SNOBOL4 language.
<P>
<LI><B>INTEGER</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                         Integer number
<P>
          A decimal number in the range -32767 to +32767.  No fractional
          part may appear.  One computer word (16 bits) is used to contain
          an integer value.
<P>
<LI><B>NAME</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                            Name of a variable
<P>
          When the unary name operator (.) is applied to a variable, two
          results are possible.  If the variable's name is a simple string
          (a &quot;natural variable&quot;), such as ABC, the variable's name is
          returned as type STRING.  For example, .ABC has the value 'ABC'.
          However, if the variable is a created variable, such as a table
          or array element, the NAME data type results.  In either case,
          the result of the name operator can be thought of as the
          &quot;address&quot; or &quot;storage location&quot; of the variable.  When the indirect
          reference operator ($) is applied to such a result, the
          original, underlying object is obtained.  That is, $(.A) is the
          same as using the variable A.
<P>
            For natural variables, SNOBOL4 has the surprising property that
          the string 'XYZ' is the address (or name) of variable XYZ, so
          $'XYZ' is equivalent to XYZ.
<P>
<LI><B>PATTERN</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                         Pattern match structure
<P>
          A pattern is created by an expression containing any of the following:
           other patterns, primitive patterns, pattern functions,
          the alternation operator (|), the conditional or immediate assignment
          operator (. or $), or the cursor position operator (@).
          A simple string is not a pattern data type, even though it may
          appear in the pattern portion of a statement.  The following are
          examples of the pattern data type:
<PRE>
    POS(0) &quot;A&quot; LEN(1)
    &quot;COLUMN A&quot; | &quot;COLUMN B&quot;
    &quot;ZIP&quot; . X
    &quot;MATCH&quot; @Y
</PRE>
<LI><B>Program-defined data type</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;        Created by DATA() function
<P>
          Up to 899 new data types may be created with the primitive function
          DATA.  The name specified in the prototype string becomes a
          new data type in SNOBOL4.  Any object created with the data
          type's creation function is given this name as its data type.
<PRE>
    DATA('COMPLEX(REAL, IMAG)')      ;* Define new type COMPLEX
    NUM = COMPLEX(2, -4)             ;* Create a COMPLEX object
    OUTPUT = DATATYPE(NUM)           ;* Print string 'COMPLEX'
</PRE>
<LI><B>REAL</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                            Real number
<P>
          A floating-point decimal number in the range 2.3E-308 to
          1.7E+308.  Reals are only available in SNOBOL4+, Catspaw's
          enhanced implementation of the SNOBOL4 language.
<P>
<LI><B>STRING</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                          Character string
<P>
          A sequence of characters.  Each character occupies one memory
          byte, and may contain any of the 256 possible bit combinations.
          A string of length zero is called the null string.  Maximum
          length of a string is determined by the keyword &amp;MAXLNGTH
          (default 5000).  Memory restrictions in Vanilla SNOBOL4 will
          limit the longest string possible to less than the 32767
          characters allowed in SNOBOL4+, Catspaw's enhanced SNOBOL4
          implementation.
<P>
<LI><B>TABLE</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                           Associatively referenced table
<P>
          The primitive function TABLE() creates a table storage area, and
          returns a pointer with this data type.  If this pointer is stored
          in a variable, the variable is said to be of type TABLE.  The
          variable may then be subscripted to access the elements of the
          table.  A table may be thought of as a one dimensional array in
          which the array subscripts may be any SNOBOL4 data type.  Arrays
          require integer subscripts, but table subscripts such as
          T&lt;&quot;TALLY&quot;&gt; or T&lt;13.52&gt; are acceptable.
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="6.2">6.2 DATA TYPE CONVERSION</A></H3>
            Data may be implicitly or explicitly converted from one type to
          another.
<H4>6.2.1 Implicit Conversion</H4>
            Implicit conversion occurs automatically when SNOBOL4 requires
          a certain data type, and your program provides it in another
          form.  Conversion to the correct data type will be attempted, and
          an error message given if conversion is not possible.
<H4>6.2.2 Explicit Conversion</H4>
            A program may use the CONVERT() function to explicitly convert
          an object to another data type.  The first argument is the object
          to be converted; the second is a string containing the formal
          name of the desired data type.  The formal name must be in uppercase
          (lower-case allowed if case-folding).  If conversion is
          possible, the function succeeds and returns the converted object.
          If not, the function fails.  The call looks like this:
<PRE>
    NEWTYPE = CONVERT(OBJECT, &quot;DESIRED TYPE&quot;)
</PRE>
<H4>6.2.3 Permissible Conversions</H4>
<DL>
<DT><B>ARRAY to STRING</B><P>
<DD>
          The formal name &quot;ARRAY&quot; is produced.  The defining array dimension
          string is appended if less than 20 characters:
<PRE>
    A = ARRAY('1:50,6')
    OUTPUT = A
</PRE>
          produces the string &quot;ARRAY('1:50,6')&quot;.
<P>
<DT><B>CODE to STRING</B><P>
<DD>
          The formal name &quot;CODE&quot; is produced:
<PRE>
    C = CODE(' PIT2 = .OPPIT4 :(RETURN)')
    OUTPUT = C
</PRE>
          displays the string &quot;CODE&quot;.
<P>
<DT><B>EXPRESSION to PATTERN</B><P>
<DD>
          This occurs implicitly within a pattern match, or by using the
          EVAL function.  The deferred expression is evaluated, using
          current values for any variables which appear.  Example:
<PRE>
    LASTN = *(RTAB(N) REM . LCHARS)
     . . .
    N = 4
    SUBJECT LASTN                        :F(TOO_SHORT)
</PRE>
<DT><B>EXPRESSION to STRING</B><P>
<DD>
          The formal name &quot;EXPRESSION&quot; is produced.  For example,
<PRE>
    LASTN = *(RTAB(N) REM . LCHARS)
    OUTPUT = LASTN
</PRE>
          produces the string &quot;EXPRESSION&quot;.
<P>
<DT><B>INTEGER to PATTERN</B><P>
<DD>
          This only occurs implicitly within a pattern match.  The integer
          is converted to a string, and the string converted to a pattern.
          Example:
<PRE>
    SUBJECT 19 = ''
</PRE>
<DT><B>INTEGER to STRING</B><P>
<DD>
          Leading zeros are suppressed, and a minus sign appears if the
          integer was negative.  Integer zero is converted to the string
          &quot;0&quot;.  For example,
<PRE>
    A = -23;  B = 0;  C = 92
    OUTPUT = A B C
</PRE>
          produces the string &quot;-23092&quot;.
<P>
<DT><B>NAME to STRING</B><P>
<DD>
          The formal name &quot;NAME&quot; is produced:
<PRE>
    N = .A[2]
    OUTPUT = N
</PRE>
          displays the string &quot;NAME&quot;.
<P>
<DT><B>PATTERN to STRING</B><P>
<DD>
          The formal name &quot;PATTERN&quot; is produced.  For example,
<PRE>
    WPAT = BREAK(LETTERS) SPAN(LETTERS) . WORD
    OUTPUT = WPAT
</PRE>
          produces the string &quot;PATTERN&quot;.
<P>
<DT><B>DEFINED</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;DATA TYPE to STRING      
<DD>
          The formal name from the defining DATA function call is returned.
<PRE>
    DATA('COMPLEX(REAL,IMAG)')
    R1 = COMPLEX(2, 3)
    OUTPUT = R1
</PRE>
          produces the string &quot;COMPLEX&quot;.
<P>
<DT><B>STRING to INTEGER</B><P>
<DD>
          The string must not have any leading or trailing blanks.  A leading
          plus or minus sign is allowed, but must be followed by at
          least one digit.  Leading zeros are allowed, and the resulting
          value must be in the legal range for integer values.  A null
          string is converted to integer zero.
<PRE>
    RESULT = (&quot;-14&quot; + &quot;&quot;) / &quot;2&quot;
</PRE>
          stores integer -7 in RESULT.
<P>
<DT><B>STRING to PATTERN</B><P>
<DD>
          This only occurs implicitly within a pattern match.  The pattern
          created will match the specified substring:
<PRE>
    SUBJECT &quot;HOPE&quot;
</PRE>
<DT><B>TABLE to ARRAY</B><P>
<DD>
          This only occurs when using the CONVERT function.  The table is
          converted to a two dimensional array.  Example:
<PRE>
    T = TABLE(100)
     . . .
    A = CONVERT(T, &quot;ARRAY&quot;)         :F(EMPTY)
</PRE>
            The table is converted to a rectangular array.  Null table
          entries are omitted, and there must be at least one nonnull entry
          or the function fails.  An N by 2 array is created, where N is
          the number of nonnull table values.  The first array column contains
          the table subscripts, the second column contains the entry
          values.
<P>
<DT><B>TABLE to STRING</B><P>
<DD>
          The formal name &quot;TABLE&quot; is returned with the present size of the
          table and its expansion increment.  For example,
<PRE>
            T = TABLE(10,10)
             . . .
    ; Insert 45 nonnull elements into T
             . . .
            OUTPUT = T
</PRE>
          produces the string &quot;TABLE(50,10)&quot; (because table segments in
          this case are allocated in multiples of 10).
<P>
            The following matrix indicates conversions with CONVERT():
<PRE>
