<H2>Chapter 1 : INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
            The reference section describes the SNOBOL4 system.  It will
          tell you how to create and run SNOBOL4 programs, and catalogs all
          the standard language features.  The tutorial section can be consulted
          for illustrative uses of various functions and operators.
<P>
            SNOBOL4 is a full implementation of the powerful development
          language SNOBOL4 for the IBM PC and the entire 8086/286/386 family
          of computers.  It has all the features of mainframe SNOBOL4,
          plus numerous useful extensions.  Compatibility with mainframe
          SNOBOL4 is achieved by basing this product on the Macro Implementation
          used on such mainframes as the IBM 370 and the CDC 7600.
          Thus, it incorporates a thoroughly tested implementation in its
          entirety.  All SNOBOL4 string and pattern matching facilities
          available in the mainframe environment are now available to the
          personal computer user.
<P>
            The SNOBOL4 program contains both a compiler and interpreter.
          They are inseparable, and share many common routines.  Your
          source program is compiled into a compact internal notation,
          which is interpreted during execution.  More information on the
          internal code may be found in Griswold's &quot;The Macro Implementation
          of SNOBOL4;&quot; see file SNOBOL4.DOC for ordering information.
<H3><A NAME="1.1">1.1 LANGUAGE BACKGROUND</A></H3>
            In 1962, several researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories
          (BTL) were applying computers to problems such as factoring multivariate
          polynomials and symbolic integration.  Available tools
          were the Symbolic Communication Language (SCL), an internal BTL
          product for processing symbolic expressions, and COMIT, designed
          for natural-language analysis.  Both proved inadequate, and
          frustration with them led the researchers to attempt the design
          of a new language.
<P>
            The original SNOBOL was developed by David J. Farber, Ralph E.
          Griswold, and Ivan P. Polonsky, and was first implemented on an
          IBM 7090 computer in 1963.  The name, SNOBOL, came after the implementation,
          and ostensibly stands for StriNg Oriented symBOlic
          Language.
<P>
            It was soon discovered that SNOBOL was applicable to a much
          wider range of problems.  In fact, the language proved more interesting
          than the problems it was intended to solve.  As more
          people used it, new features such as recursive functions were
          added, and its generality grew.  By 1964, it had become SNOBOL3,
          and was available on such machines as the IBM 7094, CDC 3600, SDS
          930, Burroughs 5500, and the RCA 601.  Because these implementations
          were all written from scratch, each machine introduced its
          own dialect of the language.
<P>
            SNOBOL3 had only one data type, the string.  The desire for additional
          data types, more complex pattern matching, and other
          features led to a major redesign of the language in 1966, by
          Ralph Griswold, Jim Poage, and Ivan Polonsky.  The new language -- SNOBOL4 -- was
          also designed to be portable to other
          machines.  Most of SNOBOL4 was completed by 1967, although some
          features, such as operator redefinition, did not appear until
          1969.  Portability was achieved by writing the system in a macro
          assembly language for an abstract machine, hence the name &quot;Macro
          Implementation of SNOBOL4.&quot;  By 1970 it was available on nine
          different types of mainframes.  Currently, it is available on
          most large- and medium-scale computers.
<P>
            The SNOBOL4 language evolved on computers whose primary input/output
          devices were the card reader, card punch, and line
          printer.  The current breed of microcomputers are interactive,
          rather than batch-oriented.  Thus, SNOBOL4 contains slight alterations
          of the language to conform to the personal computer environment.
           For example, the preassigned output keyword PUNCH has
          been replaced by SCREEN.  Experienced SNOBOL4 programmers will
          find little incompatibility with familiar implementations.  Most
          existing SNOBOL4 programs should operate correctly using SNOBOL4
          with little or no change.
