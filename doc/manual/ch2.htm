<H2>Chapter 2 : RUNNING A SNOBOL4 PROGRAM</H2>
<H3><A NAME="2.1">2.1 BASIC COMMAND LINE FORMAT</A></H3>
            The format for the command line is:
<PRE>
    SNOBOL4  file  options  ;Comments
</PRE>
            Options are specified by a slash (/) or minus sign (-), and one
          or more option letters.  When the option requires a file name, an
          equal sign may be used between the option letter and file name
          for readability.
<UL>
<LI><B>File</B><P>             The source file contains your SNOBOL4 program.  If
                     no file is specified, CON: is assumed, and programs
                     may be entered directly from the keyboard.  Disk files
                     will have extension .SNO supplied if none is specified.
</UL>
            The source and input files may be assigned to any disk file or
          valid input device.  The listing, output, and error message files
          may be assigned to any disk file or valid output device.  If the
          output disk file does not exist, it will be created.
<UL>
<LI><B>/I=file</B><P>          The input file is associated with the variable
                     INPUT when execution begins, as I/O unit 5.
                     The default is CON:, your keyboard.  Disk
                     files will have extension .IN supplied if
                     none is specified.

<P>
<LI><B>/L=file</B><P>          The listing file receives a listing of your
                     program, with assigned statement numbers.
                     Default is NUL:, that is, the listing is
                     discarded.  If /L appears without a file name,
                     the source program file name will be used,
                     with the extension changed to .LST.

<P>
<LI><B>/O=file</B><P>          The output file is associated with the variable
                     OUTPUT when execution begins.  This will be I/O
                     unit 6.  The default is CON:, which is usually
                     your computer's display screen.  Disk files will
                     have extension .OUT supplied if none is specified.
                     Execution dumps and tracings are sent to I/O unit 6.

<P>
<LI><B>/E=file</B><P>          A list of compilation and runtime error messages
                     is written to this file.  Default is CON:, that
                     is, error messages are displayed on the screen.
                     If /E appears without a file name, the source
                     program file name will be used, with the extension
                     changed to .ERR.
</UL>
            In addition to the /I and /O options, the INPUT and OUTPUT
          variables may also be assigned to files by using the MS-DOS redirection
          operators &lt; and &gt; on the command line.
<P>
            Other I/O files may be specified explicitly within the INPUT
          and OUTPUT functions, or on the command line with a unit number:
<UL>
<LI><B>/n=file</B><P>          The specified file becomes associated with
                     unit number n.  N must be in integer between
                     1 and 16.  If your program calls the INPUT or
                     OUTPUT function without a file name, the file
                     specified here will be used.  This command
                     line option merely makes an association; the
                     file is not opened or created until the INPUT
                     or OUTPUT function is called.
</UL>
            File names may be a disk file, or any DOS device, such as NUL:,
          CON:, LPT2:, etc.
<P>
            The remaining option switches alter SNOBOL4's behavior:
<UL>
<LI><B>/B</B><P>               Termination messages and statistics are normally
                     displayed via I/O unit 7 (SCREEN).  The
                     /B (batch) option instead directs them to I/O
                     unit 6 (OUTPUT).

<P>
<LI><B>/C</B><P>               SNOBOL4 defaults to case-folding, making
                     lower and upper case alphabetics equivalent
                     for names and labels.  Specifying this option
                     inhibits case-folding:  upper and lower case
                     names are unique and distinct.

<P>
<LI><B>/D</B><P>               Sets the &amp;DUMP keyword to 1.  This is useful
                     when you decide you want an end-of-run variable
                     dump, and don't want to edit the source
                              file.

<P>
<LI><B>/H</B><P>               Displays summary of options and Vanilla
                     SNOBOL4 license information.

<P>
<LI><B>/NX</B><P>              No execution after compilation.

<P>
<LI><B>/NP</B><P>              Suppress column position information in error
                     messages.

<P>
<LI><B>/P</B><P>               Displays additional product information.

<P>
<LI><B>/S</B><P>               Provide statistics upon termination.
</UL>
            Vanilla SNOBOL4 works very nicely with text editors that allow
          a program to be compiled from within the editor.  If a compilation
          or runtime error occurs, you are returned to your editor
          with the cursor positioned on the troublesome statement.  To use
          with your editor, you will need to use the command line option
          &quot;/BE-&quot;.  This writes errors messages to standard output, where
          they can be captured by your text editor.
<H3><A NAME="2.2">2.2 PROVIDING YOUR OWN PARAMETERS</A></H3>
            The keyword &amp;PARM contains the command line string.  It begins
          with the blank following the word SNOBOL4, and contains all characters
          up to the terminating carriage return.  Since SNOBOL4's
          command processor ignores all characters after a semicolon, comments
          placed there can easily communicate additional instructions
          to your program.  Break them out with the statement:
<PRE>
    &amp;PARM ';' REM . INSTRUCTIONS
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="2.3">2.3 COMMAND LINE EXAMPLES</A></H3>
            The command line:
<PRE>
    SNOBOL4 PROG
</PRE>
          will compile and run a source program from file PROG.SNO, discard
          the listing, and run it with keyboard input and screen output.
          The command line:
<PRE>
    SNOBOL4 CONVERT /I=DATA /O=RESULT /2=STYLE.DAT ;DRAFT
</PRE>
          will run a program that presumably transforms input file DATA.IN
          to output file RESULT.OUT according to program option 'DRAFT'.
          I/O unit number 2 is associated with the file STYLE.DAT.  The
          program can use the variable SCREEN to post error and status messages
          to the user, regardless of the reassignment of the input
          and output files.
<PRE>
    SNOBOL4 SOURCE /I=SOURCE.SNO /L=OUTPUT /O=OUTPUT.LST /BCS
</PRE>
          sets up a &quot;conventional&quot; batch job, with source program and input
          data on file SOURCE.SNO (following the END statement), listing
          and program output to OUTPUT.LST, no case-folding, and end-of-run
          statistics.
