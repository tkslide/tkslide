<H2>Chapter 7 : PATTERNS AND PATTERN FUNCTIONS</H2>
<P>
            The SNOBOL4 pattern matcher is called the &quot;scanner.&quot;  The
          &quot;cursor&quot; is the scanner's pointer into the subject string; it
          points between subject characters (no relation to your CRT cursor).
           It is initially zero when positioned to the left of the
          subject, and is incremented as the scanner moves to the right in
          the subject.
<H3><A NAME="7.1">7.1 PRIMITIVE PATTERNS</A></H3>
            These variables initially contain the primitive patterns of the
          same name.  They may be set to other values by a program, and restored
          to their original value from the corresponding protected
          keywords.
<UL>
<LI><B>ABORT</B><P>            Causes immediate failure of the entire pattern
 match, without seeking alternatives.

<P>
<LI><B>ARB</B><P>              Matches zero or more characters of the subject
 string.  It matches the shortest possible
 substring.

<P>
<LI><B>BAL</B><P>              Matches any nonnull string which is balanced
                     with respect to parentheses.  A string without
 parentheses is considered balanced.  BAL
                     matches the shortest string possible.

<P>
<LI><B>FAIL</B><P>             Causes failure of this portion of the pattern
                     match, causing the scanner to backtrack and
                     try alternatives.

<P>
<LI><B>FENCE</B><P>            Matches the null string and succeeds when the
                     scanner is moving left to right in a pattern,
                     but fails if the scanner has to back up
                     through it, seeking alternatives.

<P>
<LI><B>REM</B><P>              Matches zero or more characters from the current
 cursor position to the end of the subject
 string.

<P>
<LI><B>SUCCEED</B><P>          Matches the null string and always succeeds.
</UL>
            Altering these primitive patterns can produce very confusing
          programs, unless the new value encompasses the old, like this:
<PRE>
    ARB = &amp;ARB . OUTPUT
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="7.2">7.2 PRIMITIVE PATTERN FUNCTIONS</A></H3>
            These functions produce a pattern based on the argument supplied.
           The argument data type is shown below---other data types
          or expressions will be converted to the required type if
          possible.
<P>
            Pattern functions may be combined with other primitive patterns,
          functions, and strings using the alternation and concatenation
          operators to produce larger patterns.
<UL>
<LI><B>ANY(string)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                     Match one character from set
<P>
          Matches exactly one character from the set of characters specified
          by the argument string.
<P>
<LI><B>ARBNO(pattern)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                  Match repeated pattern
<P>
          Matches zero or more consecutive occurrences of the string
          matched by the argument pattern.  ARBNO matches the shortest
          string possible--initially the null string--and only tries to
          match pattern if other pattern components in the statement require
          it.
<P>
<LI><B>BREAK(string)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                   Match characters not in set
<P>
          Matches zero or more characters provided they are not in the set
          of characters in the argument string.  That is, it matches up to,
          but not including, a character from the argument string.
<P>
<LI><B>LEN(integer)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                    Match fixed length string
<P>
          Matches a string of the specified length.  There are no restrictions
          on the subject string characters.  An argument of zero will
          match the null string.
<P>
<LI><B>NOTANY(string)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                  Match one character not in set
<P>
          Matches exactly one character provided it is not in the set of
          characters specified by the argument string.
<P>
<LI><B>POS(integer)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                    Verify scanner position
<P>
          Succeeds if the scanner's current cursor position in the subject
          string is equal to the specified integer value.  This function
          merely verifies scanner position---it does not consume or match
          any subject characters.  POS(0) as the first component of a pattern
          produces an anchored pattern match.
<P>
<LI><B>RPOS(integer)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                   Verify scanner position from end
<P>
          Succeeds if the scanner's current cursor position in the subject
          string is the specified number of characters from the end of the
          string.  Like POS(), it verifies scanner position but does not
          consume any characters.  RPOS(0) as the last component of a pattern
          forces the pattern to match to the end of the subject
          string.
<P>
<LI><B>RTAB(integer)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                   Match through position counting
                                           from end
<P>
          Matches all characters from the current cursor position up to the
          specified cursor position, counting from the end of the subject
          string.  RTAB(N) matches characters up to, but not including, the
          final N characters of the subject.
<P>
<LI><B>SPAN(string)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                    Match characters in set
<P>
          Matches one or more characters from the set of characters specified
          by the argument string.  SPAN will not match the null
          string; at least one character from the argument string must be
          found in the subject.
<P>
<LI><B>TAB(integer)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                    Match through fixed position
<P>
          Matches all characters from the current cursor position up to the
          specified cursor position.  TAB(N) matches characters up to, and
          including, the initial N characters of the subject.  TAB will
          match the null string if the target position and current cursor
          position are the same.  The function fails if the current scanner
          position is to the right of the target position.
