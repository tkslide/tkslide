<H2>Chapter 8 : BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS</H2>
<P>
            In this chapter, the following items are used to indicate the
          required argument type.  Other types may be used, and will be
          automatically converted to the required type, if possible.  Integer
          suffixes will be used to distinguish multiple arguments of
          the same type.
<PRE>
    arg              A generic argument of any SNOBOL4 data type.

    array            An array.

    i                An integer number.

    name             The name of a variable, function or label,
                     such as .VAR or 'VAR'.  When case-folding,
                     'VAR' and 'var' are equivalent as names.

    s                Any SNOBOL4 string.

    table            A table.

    unit             I/O unit; an integer between 1 and 16.
</PRE>
            If an argument is omitted in a function call, SNOBOL4 supplies
          the null string instead.
<UL>
<LI><B>APPLY(name, arg1, arg2,...,argn)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indirect call to a function
<P>
          Call function name with the specified arguments.  Since name may
          be a variable containing a function name, it allows an indirect
          call to a function, similar to the :($VAR) construct in the GOTO
          field.
<P>
<LI><B>ARG(name, i)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                    Get dummy argument name from
                                           function definition
<P>
          Returns a string which is the Ith argument from the formal definition
          of program-defined function name.  ARG fails if i is
          greater than the number of arguments in name's definition.  ARG
          is useful when one function is used to trace another.  The trace
          function can access the actual argument used with the function
          being traced with an indirect reference: $ARG(name, i).
<P>
<LI><B>ARRAY(s, arg)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                   Create an array
<P>
          S is a prototype which specifies the dimensions of the array created,
          and the optional arg is the value used to initialize all
          array elements.  The form of the prototype string is:
<PRE>
    &quot;L1:H1,L2:H2,...,Ln:Hn&quot;
</PRE>
          where L and H are integers giving the lower and upper bounds of
          each dimension.  Blanks are not permitted.  If the lower bound
          and colon are omitted from any dimension, '1:' is assumed.  ARRAY
          returns a pointer to the new array, which should be assigned to a
          variable.  The variable can then be subscripted to access the
          array elements.
<P>
            A common error when defining a multidimensional array is to use
          integers instead of a string for the prototype:
<PRE>
    ARRAY(3,4) instead of ARRAY(&quot;3,4&quot;)
</PRE>
            The first example defines a 3-element, one-dimensional array,
          with elements initialized to integer 4.  The second defines a
          rectangular array, 3 rows by 4 columns.
<P>
<LI><B>CHAR(i)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                         Convert integer to ASCII
                                           character
<P>
          Converts an integer ASCII code to a one-character string.  The
          argument must be in the range 0 to 255, otherwise the function
          fails.
<P>
<LI><B>CLEAR()</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                         Clear all variables
<P>
          The null string is assigned to all variables in the system
          (including primitive patterns, such as ARB.  These patterns and
          names may be restored from the protected keywords with the same
          names (e.g., ARB = &amp;ARB).
<P>
            CLEAR does not modify variables which are currently saved on
          the function call stack.
<P>
<LI><B>CODE(s)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                         Compile a string
<P>
          Returns a pointer to the object code compiled from the SNOBOL4
          statements in string s.  This pointer can be assigned to a variable,
          and the code executed with the direct GOTO :&lt;variable&gt;.
<P>
          CODE fails if it finds a syntax error, and places an error message
          string in keyword &amp;ERRTEXT.  Individual statements in s are
          separated by a semicolon (;).  The first character following a
          semicolon must be a blank, tab, the start of a label, or a comment.
           Control and continuation statements are not allowed in s.
          Statements may be any length; the 120 character limit when compiling
          from a file does not apply.  Case-folding of names is controlled
          by keyword &amp;CASE.
<P>
<LI><B>COLLECT(i)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      Regenerate storage
<P>
          This function calls SNOBOL4's garbage collection routine, which
          reclaims all unused storage.  It returns an integer result that
          is the number of free descriptors remaining in the work space (a
          descriptor contains 5 bytes of storage).  If there are less than
          i free descriptors after regeneration, the function fails.
          SNOBOL4 automatically calls COLLECT whenever memory becomes full.
<P>
<LI><B>CONVERT(arg, s)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                 Convert to specified data type
<P>
          The argument is converted to the specified data type and returned
          as the value of the function.  If conversion is not possible, the
          function fails.  S is a data type name string, such as 'STRING',
          'TABLE', etc.  Data type names may be lower case if case-folding
          is active.  <A HREF="ch6.htm">Chapter 7</A>, &quot;Data Types and Conversion,&quot; lists allowable
          conversions.
<P>
<LI><B>COPY(arg)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                       Make copy of argument
<P>
          Returns a distinct copy of arg.  The argument may be an array,
          code block, pattern, or program-defined data type.  If A is an
          array, the statement
<PRE>
    B = COPY(A)
</PRE>
          creates a new array B, whose initial contents are the same as
          array A.  Their elements are independent; altering element A&lt;I&gt;
          does not affect element B&lt;I&gt;.  In contrast, the assignment B = A
          makes A and B alternate names for the same array.
<P>
<LI><B>DATA(s)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                         Create new data type
<P>
          Defines a new data type according to the prototype in string s.
          The prototype assumes a form similar to a function call, with the
          data type taking the place of the function name, and the field
          names replacing the arguments.  The form of the prototype string
          is
<PRE>
    &quot;NEWTYPE(FIELD1,FIELD2,...,FIELDn)&quot;
</PRE>
            The DATA function implicitly defines a new function and n new
          field variables:
<PRE>
    NEWTYPE(ARG1,ARG2,...,ARGn)     Object creation function.
    FIELD1(x)        Reference to field variable 1.

    . . .

    FIELDn(x)        Reference to field variable n.
</PRE>
          where x is an object created with the NEWTYPE function.
<P>
            The fields may be of any data type, including pointers to other
          program-defined data items.
<P>
<LI><B>DATATYPE(arg)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                   Get data type of argument
<P>
          Returns a string specifying the data type of the argument.  Some
          typical arguments and their data types are:
<PRE>
    12               INTEGER

    'ABCD'           STRING

    POS(2) 'C' LEN(3)     PATTERN

    .Q&lt;3&gt;            NAME

    *PAT             EXPRESSION
</PRE>
            If the argument is a program-defined data type, the name from
          the creating DATA() function is returned.
<P>
<LI><B>DATE()</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                          Get current date and time
<P>
          Returns a 20-character string of the form:
<PRE>
    'MM-DD-YY HH:MM:SS.CC'
</PRE>
          representing month, day, year, hour, minute, second, and centisecond
          respectively.  The centisecond field can only be approximated,
          since many personal computer clocks are only updated
          every 55 milliseconds.
<P>
<LI><B>DEFINE(s, name)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                 Create program-defined function
<P>
          This function creates a new, program-defined function.  S is a
          prototype string specifying the function's name, arguments, and
          local variables, if any.  Name is optional, and specifies a label
          as the first statement of the function body.  If absent, a label
          with the same name as the function is the assumed entry point.
          The form of the prototype string is
<PRE>
    &quot;FNAME(ARG1,ARG2,...,ARGn)LOCAL1,LOCAL2,...,LOCALn&quot;
</PRE>
          where FNAME is the name of the function, and ARGi are names of
          formal arguments to the function.  Blanks are not permitted in
          the prototype.  The values of variables specified in the list of
          locals are saved prior to function entry, and restored upon function
          return.
<P>
            Functions may return a value or variable name by assigning the
          result to a variable with the same name as the function.  Functions
          return by transferring to one of the reserved labels
          RETURN, NRETURN, or FRETURN to return by value, by name, or to
          fail respectively.
<P>
<LI><B>DETACH(name)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                    Remove I/O association
<P>
          Removes any input or output unit associated with the variable
          name.  The underlying file is not affected in any way.  Remember
          that name is the address of the variable (e.g. .X or 'X'), not
          the variable itself.
<P>
<LI><B>DIFFER(arg1, arg2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;              Check if arguments are different
<P>
          Succeeds and returns the null string if and only if arg1 and arg2
          are different.  Strings and integers are different if they have
          unequal values.  Other data types contain pointers to the actual
          data object, and differ only if the pointers are different.  If
          arg2 is omitted, DIFFER succeeds if arg1 is not null.
<P>
<LI><B>DUMP(i)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                         Dump variables
<P>
          This function causes all natural variables with nonnull values to
          be listed on the file associated with I/O unit 6 (normally
          OUTPUT).  If i is zero, the dump does not occur.
<P>
<LI><B>DUPL(s, i)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      Duplicate string
<P>
          Returns the argument string s repeated i times.  The function
          returns the null string if i is zero, and fails if i is negative.
<P>
<LI><B>ENDFILE(unit)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                   Close file
<P>
          The file attached to the specified I/O unit is closed, and the
          file buffer is flushed and released.  All variables which have
          been associated with this unit have their association removed.
          Upon program termination, SNOBOL4 will automatically perform an
          ENDFILE function on all open units.
<P>
<LI><B>EQ(i1, i2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      Equality test for numbers
<P>
          This function succeeds and returns the null string if the two
          integer arguments are equal.  I1 and i2 must evaluate to integer
          values.  The function fails if i1 is not equal to i2.
<P>
<LI><B>EVAL(s or n)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                    Compile and evaluate expression
<P>
          If the argument is a string, it should contain a valid SNOBOL4
          expression to be compiled and evaluated.  The evaluation result
          is returned as the value of the function.  EVAL fails and sets
          &amp;ERRTEXT to an error message string if s contains a syntactic error.
           If the argument is a number, i, it is returned unchanged.
          If the argument is an unevaluated expression, it is evaluated,
          and the result returned.
<P>
<LI><B>FIELD(s, i)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                     Get field name of defined data
                                           type
<P>
          Returns a string which is the Ith field name from the formal definition
          of the program-defined data type whose name is in string
          s.  FIELD fails if i is greater than the number of fields in the
          data type's definition.
<P>
<LI><B>GE(i1, i2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      Greater than or equal test for
                                           numbers
<P>
          This function succeeds and returns the null string if the two
          integer arguments satisfy the relationship i1 &gt;= i2.  I1 and i2
          must evaluate to integer values.  The function fails if i1 is
          less than i2.
<P>
<LI><B>GT(i1,i2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                       Greater than test for numbers
<P>
          This function succeeds and returns the null string if the two integer
          arguments satisfy the relationship i1 &gt; i2.  I1 and i2 must
          evaluate to integer values.  The function fails if i1 is less
          than or equal to i2.
<P>
<LI><B>IDENT(arg1, arg2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;               Check if arguments are identical
<P>
          Succeeds and returns the null string if and only if arg1 and arg2
          are identical.  Strings and integers re identical if they have
          the same values.  Other data types contain pointers to the actual
          data object, and are identical only if they point to the same
          object.  If arg2 is omitted, IDENT succeeds if arg1 is the null
          string.
<P>
<LI><B>INPUT(Name, Unit, i, s)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;         Open file for input
<P>
          This function opens a file for input, and associates it with a
          variable.  Data may then be read from the file by using the variable
          in an expression or an assignment statement.
<P>
            The file designated by string S is opened for input and given
          the specified unit number.  I is an optional record length.  The
          variable specified by Name is associated with this unit.
<P>
            The first argument, Name, specifies a SNOBOL4 variable, typically
          as a quoted string or with the unary period operator:
<PRE>
    INPUT('IN', ...
    INPUT(.IN, ...
    X = 'IN'
    INPUT(X, ...
</PRE>
            The second argument, Unit, must evaluate to an integer value in
          the range 0 to 16 inclusive.  Unit 0 (or omitting the unit argument)
          will select the default input unit, 5.
<P>
            The third argument, I, contains the record length in characters.
           0 &lt; I &lt;= &amp;MAXLNGTH.  If omitted, the default is 80.
<P>
            The fourth argument, S, is a string containing the name of the
          file to be opened.  If the file is a disk file, S may contain an
          optional drive letter and pathname in addition to the filename.
          Besides disk files, MS-DOS device names such as NUL:, CON:,
          COM2:, etc., are permitted.
<P>
            If S is absent or null, and this unit is not currently open,
          the SNOBOL4 command line is searched for a file to use with this
          unit (/n:file).  If S is absent, but the unit is already open,
          the INPUT call serves only to establish another association
          between a variable and the unit.  If S is not null, any file previously
          associated with this unit number is first closed by
          SNOBOL4 with an implicit ENDFILE(unit).
<P>
            An error message is generated for an illegal unit number.  The
          INPUT function fails (with no printed error message) if the file
          cannot be opened.
<P>
            The record length I (or its default value, 80), determines the
          number of characters returned in a string when the associated
          variable is referenced.  ASCII files will return I characters or
          less if an end-of-line condition is encountered.  End-of-line is
          defined as either a carriage return, or a carriage return followed
          by a line feed.  If I characters are read from an ASCII
          file without encountering an end-of-line, additional characters
          are read from the file and discarded until the end-of-line character(s)
          are found.  That is, long lines are truncated.  If less
          than I characters are read from an ASCII file, and keyword &amp;TRIM
          is zero, the line will be padded with blank characters until
          length i is obtained.
<P>
            A read operation will terminate on the last character of a disk
          file, returning a short record.  Reading past the End-of-File
          will cause statement failure.  If the file is ASCII, reading a
          control-Z character will be treated as an End-of-File.
<P>
            Note:  When program begins execution, the variable INPUT is
          associated with unit 5.  Unit 5 is normally device CON:, the keyboard,
          unless redirected elsewhere by the /I=file command line
          option, or the MS-DOS redirection operation (&lt;file).
<P>
<LI><B>INTEGER(arg)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                    Check if argument is an integer
<P>
          Succeeds and returns the null string if arg is an integer, or a
          string which can be converted to an integer.  If the argument is
          not an integer, the function fails.
<P>
<LI><B>ITEM(array, i1, i2, ..., in)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Get array element
<P>
          ITEM(table, arg)                 Get table element
<P>
          Returns the specified array or table element.  I1, i2, ..., in
          are array subscripts, and arg is a table subscript.  Since the
          first argument may be a function which returns an array or table
          name, it allows an indirect reference in situations that would
          not be syntactically valid.  ITEM is an analog of the APPLY function.
           For example, if F(X) is a program-defined function which
          returns an array name,
<PRE>
    ITEM(F(X), 20)
</PRE>
          references the 20th element of that array, whereas F(X)&lt;20&gt; is
          not acceptable.
<P>
<LI><B>LE(i1, i2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      Less than or equal test for
                                           numbers
<P>
          This function succeeds and returns the null string if the two
          integer arguments satisfy the relationship i1 &lt;= i2.  I1 and i2
          must evaluate to integer values.  The function fails if i1 is
          greater than i2.
<P>
<LI><B>LGT(s1, s2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                     Lexically greater than test for
                                           strings
<P>
          This function succeeds and returns the null string if s1 is lexically
          greater than s2 (according to their alphabetic ordering).
          The two strings are compared left to right, character by character.
           If one string is exhausted before the other---with all
          characters equal---the longer string is lexically greater than
          the shorter string.  The null string is lexically less than any
          other non-null string.  If there is a character mismatch at the
          same position in both strings, the relationship between the characters
          determines the relationship of the strings.  Strings are
          equal only if they are the same length, and are identical character
          by character.
<P>
<LI><B>LOCAL(name, i)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                  Get local variable name from
                                           function definition
<P>
          Returns a string which is the Ith local variable from the formal
          definition of program-defined function name.  LOCAL fails if i is
          greater than the number of local variables in name's definition.
          LOCAL is useful when one function is used to trace another.  The
          trace function can access the local variables used with the funcion
          being traced with an indirect reference: $LOCAL(name, i).
<P>
<LI><B>LPAD(s1, i, s2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                 Pad left end of string
<P>
          This function is useful for right-justifying columnar output.  It
          returns s1 padded on its left end until its total size is i characters.
           The pad character used is the first character of s2 if
          present, otherwise a blank is used if s2 is absent or null.  If i
          is less than or equal to the length of s1, s1 is returned unchanged.
<P>
<LI><B>LT(i1, i2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      Less than test for numbers
<P>
          This function succeeds and returns the null string if the two integer
          arguments satisfy the relationship i1 &lt; i2.  I1 and i2 must
          evaluate to integer values.  The function fails if i1 is greater
          than or equal to i2.
<P>
<LI><B>NE(i1, i2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                      Not equal test for numbers
<P>
          This function succeeds and returns the null string if the two integer
          arguments are not equal.  I1 and i2 must evaluate to integer
          values.  The function fails if i1 is equal to i2.
<P>
<LI><B>OPSYN(s1, s2, i)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                Create operator synonym
<P>
          The function or operator name s1 becomes a synonym for s2.  If i
          is absent or 0, both strings are assumed to be function names.
          If i is 1 or 2, then the strings are assumed to be unary or
          binary operators, respectively.  Other values for i are illegal.
          Operators are specified by using their graphic symbol in a quoted
          literal, such as:
<PRE>
    OPSYN('#', '/', 2)
</PRE>
            The concatenation operator is specified as a one-character
          string containing a blank: ' '.  The implicit pattern match operator
          between subject and pattern cannot be OPSYNed.
<P>
<LI><B>OUTPUT(name, unit, i, s)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;        Open file for output
<P>
          This function opens a file for output, and associates it with a
          variable.  Data may then be written to the file by assigning values
          to the variable.
<P>
            The description of the OUTPUT function parallels that of the
          INPUT function, and will not be duplicated here.  The following
          differences are noted below.
<P>
            If the output file already exists, it is deleted and recreated
          anew.  Facilities for updating existing files (direct-access
          files) are not present in Vanilla SNOBOL4; they are contained in
          SNOBOL4+, Catspaw's enhanced implementation of the SNOBOL4 language.
<P>
                     When an output variable is assigned a string value, the string
          is written to the associated file.  A carriage return and line
          feed appended to the string.  If the string is longer than the
          record length (i, or the default, 80), a carriage return and line
          feed will be inserted every i characters.  That is, long strings
          will create multiple output lines.
<P>
            Note:  When a program begins execution, the variable OUTPUT is
          associated with unit 6.  Unit 6 is normally device CON:, the display,
          unless redirected elsewhere by the /O: command line option
          or the MS-DOS redirection operation (&gt;file).  The variable SCREEN
          is associated with unit 7, which is also attached to device CON:.
<P>
<LI><B>PROTOTYPE(array)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                Get prototype which created an
                                           array
<P>
          Returns the prototype string of dimensions used to create the
          specified array.  If the array was created by the ARRAY function,
          then the string returned is identical to the first argument of
          the original ARRAY function call.  If the array was produced from
          a table by the CONVERT function, the string has the form 'N,2',
          where N is the integer number of rows in the array.
<P>
<LI><B>REMDR(i1, i2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                   Get remainder after division
<P>
          REMDR returns the integer remainder resulting from i1 divided by
          i2, that is, i1 modulus i2.  The result has the same sign as i1.
<P>
<LI><B>REPLACE(s1, s2, s3)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;             Replace characters in string
<P>
          This function returns s1 transformed according to a translation
          specified by s2 and s3.  Each character of s1 found in s2 is replaced
          by the corresponding character in s3.  S2 and s3 must be
          the same length.  If duplicate characters appear in s2, the
          rightmost one is used to obtain the mapping character from s3.
          Normally, s2 and s3 are thought of as parameters, and REPLACE
          performs character substitutions on the variable s1.  For
          instance:
<PRE>
    REPLACE(S, 'aeiouAEIOU', '1234512345')
</PRE>
          replaces all upper- and lower-case vowels in S with the digits 1
          through 5.  It is possible to use REPLACE as a &quot;transposition&quot;
          function if s1 and s2 are considered parameters, and s3 allowed
          to vary.  If s1 and s2 are the same length, a simple positional
          transformation results.  For example,
<PRE>
    REPLACE('123456', '214365', S)
</PRE>
          returns the six character string S with adjacent pairs of characters
          interchanged ('ABCDEF' becomes 'BADCFE').  S1 and s2 can be
          different lengths---only s2 and s3 must be the same size.  If s2
          contains characters not in s1, the corresponding characters in s3
          are dropped from the result.  If s1 contains characters not in
          s2, they will appear in the result.  The function call
<PRE>
    REPLACE('Yy/Mm/Dd', 'Mm-Dd-Yy xx:xx:xx.xx', DATE())
</PRE>
          returns the date in the form YY/MM/DD (e.g., 87/07/28).  Duplicate
          characters in s1 are permitted, so:
<PRE>
    REPLACE('aaabbbccc', 'abc' '(1)')
</PRE>
          produces '(((111)))'.
<P>
<LI><B>RPAD(s1, i, s2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                 Pad right end of string
<P>
          This function is useful for left-justifying columnar output.  It
          returns s1 padded on its right end until its total size is i
          characters.  The pad character used is the first character of s2
          if present, otherwise a blank (ASCII character 32) is used if s2
          is absent or null.  If i is less than or equal to the length of
          s1, s1 is returned unchanged.
<P>
<LI><B>SIZE(s)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                         Get length of string
<P>
          The function SIZE returns an integer value which is the number of
          characters in its argument string.  A null string argument
          returns 0.
<P>
<LI><B>STOPTR(name, type)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;              Stop trace
<P>
          Discontinues the type of trace of the named item.  Consult the
          TRACE() function for a list of tracing types available.
<P>
<LI><B>TABLE(i1, i2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                   Create a table
<P>
          A table is similar to a one-dimensional array, but the subscripts
          may be any SNOBOL4 data type.  The TABLE function creates a table
          and returns a pointer to it.  The integer i1 specifies the initial
          number of entries in the table.  Integer i2 specifies the
          size by which the table is increased whenever it becomes full,
          and additional table space is required.  If either is omitted, 10
          is used as a default value.
<P>
<LI><B>TIME()</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                          Get execution time
<P>
          Returns the number of tenths of a second elapsed since the start
          of program execution, including all I/O wait time.
<P>
<LI><B>TRACE(name1, type, s, name2)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Trace an entity
<P>
          The item name1 is traced according to the action specified by
          type.  Trace output is written to the file associated with I/O
          unit 6.
<P>
            Name1 is a the name of a variable, function, statement label,
          or keyword.  It may appear as a string, or specified with the
          unary name operator (.).
<P>
            Type is a string that determines the type of trace desired.  It
          must be one of these values:
<PRE>
    'VALUE'          When value of name1 is changed (default if
                     type omitted).

    'CALL'           When function name1 is called.

    'RETURN'         When function name1 returns.

    'FUNCTION'       When function name1 is called, or returns.

    'LABEL'          When control is transferred to label name1.

    'KEYWORD'        When the value of keyword &amp;name1 is changed.
                     Note that the ampersand character (&amp;) is not
                     included in the first argument, name1.
</PRE>
            S is an optional identifying tag that is added to the trace
          output line when name1 is a created object, such as an array or
          table element.
<P>
            Name2 is an optional name of a program-defined function.
<P>
          Instead of producing a trace output line, this function is called
          when the trace action occurs.  The function is called with name1
          as the first argument, and string s as the second argument.
<P>
            Tracing will only occur when the keyword &amp;TRACE is nonzero.
          Each trace will decrement &amp;TRACE by one.  Tracing ends when it
          becomes zero.
<P>
<LI><B>TRIM(s)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                         Remove trailing blanks
<P>
          Returns the argument string with trailing blanks removed.  Trailing
          tab characters are not affected.  If the argument string was
          read from an input file, it is more efficient to set keyword
          &amp;TRIM nonzero than to use TRIM(INPUT).
<P>
            By combining function TRIM with REPLACE, any trailing character
          can be removed.  The desired character is temporarily exchanged
          with blank, trimmed, then exchanged back.  For example, this
          expression returns string S with trailing zeros removed:
<PRE>
    REPLACE(TRIM(REPLACE(S,'0 ',' 0')),'0 ',' 0')
</PRE>
<P>
<LI><B>UNLOAD(name)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                    Remove function definition
<P>
          The function name becomes undefined.
<P>
<LI><B>VALUE(name)</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                     Get value of an object
<P>
          The VALUE function returns the value of the variable name,
          behaving like the unary indirect operator ($).
