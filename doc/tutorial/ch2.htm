<H2>Chapter 2 : CONTROL FLOW AND FUNCTIONS</H2>
<H3><A NAME="2.1">
                         2.1 SUCCESS AND FAILURE
</A></H3>
<P>
      Success and failure are as important in SNOBOL4 as they are in
    life.  Success and failure are unmistakable signals; something
    either worked, or it didn't.  Significant program conciseness is
    achieved by recognizing that data values and signals are fundamentally
    different entities.
<P>
      The elements of a statement provide values and signals as computation
    proceeds.  SNOBOL4 accumulates both, and stops executing
    a particular statement when it finds it cannot succeed.  Program
    flow can be altered based upon this success or failure.
<P>
      The success signal will have a value result associated with it.
    In situations in which the signal itself is the desired object,
    the result value may only be the null string.  The failure signal
    has no associated value.  (In some instances, it may be helpful
    to view failure as meaning &quot;failure to produce a result.&quot;)
<P>
      Previously, we introduced the variable INPUT, which reads a
    line from the keyboard.  In general, INPUT can be made to read
    from any disk file.  The line read may be any character string,
    including the null string if it is an empty line.  If any string
    might appear, then there is no special value we can test for to
    detect End-of-File.  Success and failure provide an elegant
    alternative to testing for special values.
<P>
      When we retrieve a value from INPUT, we normally get a string
    and a success signal.  But when End-of-File is encountered, we
    get a failure signal instead, and no value.
<P>
      Since control-Z (or function key 6) allows you to enter an Endof-File
    from the keyboard, we can easily demonstrate this type of
    failure.  As you've noticed, the CODE.SNO program reports the
    success or failure of each statement.  So far, all examples have
    succeeded.  Now try this one:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = INPUT
    ^Z
    Failure
</PRE>
      Success and failure are control signals, and appear only during
    the execution of a statement.  They cannot be stored in a variable,
    which holds values only.
<P>
      There is much more which can be done with success and failure,
    but to understand their use, you'll need to know how SNOBOL4
    statements are constructed.
<H3><A NAME="2.2">
                         2.2 A SNOBOL4 STATEMENT
</A></H3>
<P>
      In general, a SNOBOL4 statement looks like this:
<PRE>
    Label   Statement body                                 :GOTO
</PRE>
      The label is optional, and is omitted by placing a blank or tab
    in the first character position.  The GOTO is also optional, and
    can be eliminated simply by omitting it and the colon.  In fact,
    even the statement body is optional.  You can have a program line
    consisting of just a label or a GOTO field.
<H3><A NAME="2.2.1">
    2.2.1 The Label Field
</A></H3>
<P>
      SNOBOL4 normally executes the statements of a program in
    sequence.  The ability to transfer control from one statement to
    another, perhaps conditionally, makes SNOBOL4 much more usable.
<P>
      Labels provide names for statements.  If present, they must
    begin in the first character position of a statement, and must
    start with a letter or number.  Additional characters may be anything
    but blank or tab.  Like variable names, lower-case letters
    are equivalent to upper-case when case-folding (the default).
<H3><A NAME="2.2.1">
    2.2.1 The GOTO Field
</A></H3>
<P>
      Transfer of control is made possible by the GOTO.  It interrupts
    the normal sequential execution of statements by telling
    SNOBOL4 which statement to execute after the present one.  The
    GOTO field appears at the end of the statement, preceded by a
    colon (:), and has one of these forms:
<PRE>
    :(label)
    :S(label)
    :F(label)
    :S(label1) F(label2)
</PRE>
      White space is required before the colon.  &quot;Label&quot; is the name
    given the target statement, and must be enclosed in parentheses.
    If the first form is used, execution resumes at the referenced
    statement, unconditionally.  In the second and third forms,
    transfer occurs only if the statement has succeeded or failed,
    respectively.  Otherwise, execution proceeds to the next statement
    in line.  If the fourth form is used, transfer is made to
    label1 if the statement succeeded, or to label2 if it failed.  A
    statement with a label and a GOTO would look like this:
<PRE>
    COPY    OUTPUT = INPUT           :F(DONE)
</PRE>
      Now let's write a short program which copies keyboard input to
    the screen, and reports the total number of lines.  If you are an
    accurate typist, you can type it into SNOBOL4 directly.  Otherwise,
    you should use your text editor to create a file containing
    the program text.  First stop the CODE.SNO program by typing END:
<PRE>
    ?END

    B&gt;SNOBOL4 CON

    Vanilla SNOBOL4      Version 2.14.
    (c) Copyright 1984,1988 Catspaw, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
    Enter program, terminate with &quot;END&quot;
    ?       N = 0
    ?COPY   OUTPUT = INPUT           :F(DONE)
    ?       N = N + 1                :(COPY)
    ?DONE   OUTPUT = 'THERE WERE ' N ' LINES'
    ?END

    No errors

    TYPE IN A TEST LINE
    TYPE IN A TEST LINE

    AND ANOTHER
    AND ANOTHER

    ^Z
    THERE WERE 2 LINES

    B&gt;
</PRE>
      We start the line count in variable N at 0.  The next statement
    has a label, COPY, a statement body, and a GOTO field.  It is an
    assignment statement, and begins execution by reading a line of
    input.  If INPUT successfully obtains a line, the result is
    stored in OUTPUT.  The GOTO field is only testing for failure, so
    SNOBOL4 proceeds to the next statement, where N is incremented,
    and the unconditional GOTO transfers back to statement COPY.
<P>
      When an End-of-File is read, variable INPUT signals failure.
    Execution of this statement terminates immediately, without performing
    the assignment, and transfers to the statement labeled
    DONE.  The number of lines is displayed, and control flows into
    the END statement, stopping the program.
<H3><A NAME="2.3">
                         2.3 BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS
</A></H3>
<P>
      A function is analogous to an operator; it operates on data to
    produce a result.  The data objects are called the arguments of
    the function.  The result returned -- the function of the arguments -- may
    have two components: the success or failure signal;
    and for success, a value.  The value may be any data type.
<P>
      A function is used by writing its name and a list of arguments
    enclosed by parentheses:
<PRE>
    FUNCTION_NAME(ARG1, ARG2, ..., ARGn)
</PRE>
      It may appear in your program anywhere a constant is allowed -- 
    in expressions, patterns, even as the argument of another function.
     If the function has more than one argument, they should be
    separated by commas.  If trailing arguments are omitted, SNOBOL4
    will supply the null string instead.  Some functions, such as one
    that returns the current date, have no arguments at all.
<P>
      SNOBOL4 provides a large number of predefined functions, and
    allows you to define your own.  The large repertoire of built-in
    functions makes SNOBOL4 programming easier.  Most functions are
    concerned with pattern matching, input/output, and advanced features
    of the language.  Here we'll introduce a few simple
    conditional, numeric, and string functions to give you an idea of
    the variety.  Try them interactively with CODE.SNO.
<H3><A NAME="2.3.1">
    2.3.1 Conditional Functions
</A></H3>
<P>
      These functions fail or succeed depending upon their arguments.
    They are sometimes called predicate functions because the success
    of an expression using them is predicated upon their success.  If
    they succeed, they return the null string as their value.
<PRE>
    Function         Succeeds if:

    IDENT(S,T)       S and T are identical.  S and T may be constants
                     or variables with any data type.  To
                     be identical, the arguments must have the
                     same data type and value.  Since omitted arguments
                     default to the null string, IDENT(S)
                     succeeds if S is the null string.

    DIFFER(S,T)      S and T are different.  DIFFER is the opposite
                     of IDENT.  DIFFER(S) succeeds if S is
                     not the null string.

    EQ(X,Y)          Integers X and Y are equal.  X and Y must be
                     integers, or strings which can be converted
                     to integers.

    NE(X,Y)          Integers X and Y are not equal.

    GE(X,Y)          Integer X is greater than or equal to Y.

    GT(X,Y)          Integer X is greater than Y.

    LE(X,Y)          Integer X is less than or equal to Y.

    LT(X,Y)          Integer X is less than Y.

    INTEGER(X)       X is an integer, or a string which can be
                     converted to an integer.

    LGT(S,T)         String S is lexically greater than string T
                     using a character-by-character comparison.
</PRE>
      Leading blanks may be used in front of a argument for readability.
     Here are some exercises for CODE.SNO:
<PRE>
    ?       N = 3
    ?       EQ(N, 3)
    Success
    ?       IDENT(N, 3)
    Success
    ?       EQ(3, &quot;3&quot;)
    Success
    ?IDENT(3, &quot;3&quot;)                   (integer and string)
    Failure
    ?       EQ(N, 4)
    Failure
    ?       NE(N, 4)
    Success
    ?       INTEGER(N)
    Success
    ?       INTEGER('47')
    Success
    ?       DIFFER('ABC', 'abc')
    Success
    ?       IDENT('a' 'b' 'c', 'abc')
    Success
    ?       LGT('ABC', 'ABD')
    Failure
</PRE>
      When any of these functions succeed, they return a null string.
    Since other statement elements are not altered when concatenated
    with the null string, this provides an easy way to interpose
    tests and construct loops.  Suppose we execute the statement:
<PRE>
    N = LT(N,10) N + 1       :S(LOOP)
</PRE>
      Function LT fails if N is 10 or greater.  If the statement
    fails, the assignment is not performed, and execution continues
    with the next statement.  However, if LT succeeds, its null
    string value is concatenated with the expression N + 1, and the
    result is assigned to N.  This has the effect of increasing N by
    1 and transferring to statement LOOP until N reaches 10.
<P>
      If we concatenated several conditional functions together, and
    they all succeeded, the result would still be the null string.
    If any function failed, the entire concatenation would fail.
    This gives us a simple way to produce a successful result if a
    number of conditions are all true.  For example, the expression:
<PRE>
    INTEGER(N) GE(N,5) LE(N,100)
</PRE>
    succeeds if N is an integer between 5 and 100.
<H3><A NAME="2.3.2">
    2.3.2 Other Functions
</A></H3>
<P>
      These functions always succeed; all but REMDR and SIZE return a
    string result.
<PRE>
    DATE()              Return current date and time as a string.

    DUPL(S,N)           Duplicate string S, N times.

    REMDR(X,Y)          Produce the remainder (modulus) of X / Y.

    REPLACE(S1,S2,S3)   Return string S1 after performing the
                        character replacements specified by strings
                        S2 and S3.  S2 specifies which characters to
                        replace, and S3 specifies what to replace
                        them with.

    SIZE(S)             Return the number of characters in string S.

    TRIM(S)             Return string S with trailing blanks removed.
</PRE>
      Exercises for CODE.SNO:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = 'THE DATE AND TIME ARE: ' DATE()
    THE DATE AND TIME ARE: 10-19-87 11:49:33.90
    ?       OUTPUT = DUPL('ABC', 20)
    ABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABCABC
    ?       OUTPUT = SIZE('ZIPPY')
    5
    ?       OUTPUT = SIZE('')
    0
    ?       OUTPUT = TRIM('TRAILING BLANKS  ') 'GONE'
    TRAILING BLANKSGONE
    ?       OUTPUT = REPLACE('spoon','po','PO')
