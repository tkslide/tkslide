<H2>Chapter 5 : ADDITIONAL OPERATORS AND DATA TYPES</H2>
<P>
      In this chapter we will explore some additional SNOBOL4 operators
    and data types.  Many of these concepts are entirely absent
    from other programming languages.  Far from being esoteric, they
    fit quite naturally into SNOBOL4, and add to its conciseness and
    power of expression.  In the following examples, we will continue
    to use the CODE.SNO program to illustrate each new idea.
<H3><A NAME="5.1">
                         5.1 INDIRECT REFERENCE
</A></H3>
<P>
      In conventional programming languages, a variable's name may be
    specified only at the time the program is written.  In fact, once
    the run-time storage has been allocated, the textual form of the
    name can be discarded.  This is not the case in SNOBOL4; you can
    create new variables during execution, and reference existing
    ones from names specified in character strings.
<P>
      The unary operator dollar sign ($) is the &quot;indirect reference
    operator.&quot;  By applying it to a variable you instruct SNOBOL4 to
    use its contents as the name of another variable, and to continue
    on to reference that variable.  SNOBOL4 &quot;goes through&quot; the operand
    to reach the variable.  Try the following simple example:
<PRE>
    ?       DOG = 'BARK'
    ?       CAT = 'MEOW'
    ?       ANIMAL = 'CAT'
    ?       OUTPUT = $ANIMAL
    MEOW
    ?       ANIMAL = 'DOG'
    ?       OUTPUT = $ANIMAL
    BARK
</PRE>
      These statements make their indirect reference through the
    string contained in variable ANIMAL.  ANIMAL's contents are
    treated as a &quot;pointer&quot; to the final destination.  That is, using
    ANIMAL by itself retrieves the string 'DOG', while $ANIMAL refers
    to the variable DOG.
<P>
      New variables may also be created by using an indirect reference
    as the object of an assignment.  Here, $DOG causes variable
    BARK to be created, and assigned the string 'RUFF':
<PRE>
    ?       $DOG = 'RUFF'
    ?       OUTPUT = BARK
    RUFF
</PRE>
      Indirect referencing may proceed to any depth, provided the
    null string is never encountered as a variable name:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = $ANIMAL '-' $$ANIMAL
    BARK-RUFF
    ?       OUTPUT = $RUFF
    Execution error #4, Null string in illegal context
</PRE>
      In the first example, $ANIMAL produces the contents of variable
    DOG, while $$ANIMAL refers to the variable BARK.  The second example
    attempts to go through RUFF -- which was not previously defined -- and
    obtains the null string.  Of course, the null string
    is not a valid variable name.
<H3><A NAME="5.1.1">
    5.1.1 Associative Programming
</A></H3>
<P>
      Indirect referencing provides a means of &quot;programming by association.&quot;
     Suppose we want to write a program that allows the
    user to enter a state name and receive the state's capital in
    response.  We've provided a data file called CAPITAL.DAT, in
    which each line contains a state name, comma, and the capital.
    The first part of the program will read the file and set up an
    associative data base:
<PRE>
    *  Trim input, attach data file to variable INFILE
            &amp;TRIM = 1
            INPUT('INFILE', 1, , 'CAPITAL.DAT')       :F(ERR)

    *  Read a line from file.  Start querying upon EOF
    READF   LINE = INFILE                             :F(QUERY)

    *  Break out state and capital from line
            LINE BREAK(',') . STATE LEN(1) REM . CAPITAL :F(ERR)

    *  Convert state name into a variable, and assign the
    *  capital city string to it.  Then read next line.
            $STATE = CAPITAL                          :(READF)

    ERR     OUTPUT = 'Illegal data file'              :(END)
    QUERY    . . .
</PRE>
      We attach the file, and associate variable INFILE with it.
    Successive file lines are read into variable LINE.  Pattern
    matching assigns the state name and capital city to variables
    STATE and CAPITAL respectively.  We use an indirect reference
    through $STATE to create a new variable with the state's name,
    and assign the capital city to it.  For example, the file line
    'COLORADO,DENVER' creates variable COLORADO, containing 'DENVER'.
<P>
      Having established a data base, completing the program to access
    it is trivial:
<PRE>
    *  Read state name, access it as a variable
    QUERY   OUTPUT = $INPUT                           :S(QUERY)
    END
</PRE>
      An input line is read from the user, and used for an indirect
    reference.  If the user types a state name, treating it as a
    variable name obtains the state capital.  An invalid state name
    would reference a new variable, whose value is the null string,
    and a blank line would be output.  A more complete program might
    test for this null string and produce an error message.
<P>
      The addition of one statement to the program loop creating the
    data base allows us to enter either the state name or capital
    city, and obtain the other:
<PRE>
    $STATE = CAPITAL
    $CAPITAL = STATE                          :(READF)
</PRE>
      How would we solve this problem in a language like BASIC?
    States and capitals could be stored in an array.  We would then
    use a loop to sequentially compare the user's input string with
    the array elements.  If a match were found, the result would be
    displayed from another array element.  In SNOBOL4, we did it all
    with one statement: OUTPUT = $INPUT.  Associative programming can
    often replace a conventional linear search.
<H3><A NAME="5.1.2">
    5.1.2 Variable Names
</A></H3>
<P>
      Earlier I said that variable names were composed of letters,
    digits, and the characters period and underscore.  These restrictions
    apply only to variables which appear in program text.  Variable
    names created or referenced with the indirect reference
    operator may be composed of ANY nonnull string of characters, and
    may be as long as any other string.  If we set keyword &amp;DUMP
    nonzero, we would see a list of states and capitals when the
    program terminated.  The variable names created by $STATE are in
    the left column, and their string contents in the right column:
<PRE>
    ALABAMA = 'MONTGOMERY'
    ALASKA = 'JUNEAU'
          . . .
    NEW HAMPSHIRE = 'CONCORD'
</PRE>
      The dump reveals a variable named NEW HAMPSHIRE, which contains
    a &quot;blank&quot; within its name.  Clearly, you cannot directly say:
<PRE>
    NEW HAMPSHIRE = 'CONCORD'
</PRE>
    since SNOBOL4 sees this as a pattern match statement: variable
    NEW is the subject, and variable HAMPSHIRE contains the pattern.
    To reference this variable, we must use:
<PRE>
    $'NEW HAMPSHIRE' = 'CONCORD'
</PRE>
      Try CODE.SNO with some unconventional variable names:
<PRE>
    ?       $'&quot;' = 'DOUBLE QUOTE'
    ?       $'$#@!*' = 53
    ?       OUTPUT = $'$#@!*' $'&quot;'
    53 DOUBLE QUOTE
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="5.1.3">
    5.1.3 Indirect GOTOs
</A></H3>
<P>
      Indirect referencing is not restricted to the main body of a
    statement.  It may be used in the GOTO field to transfer control
    to a label specified by a variable.  Suppose variable OP held the
    one-character string '+', '-', '*', or '/'.  This GOTO would
    transfer to one of four statements, labeled L+, L-, L*, or L/:
<PRE>
            statement                            :($('L' OP))
    L+      statement
    L-      statement
</PRE>
      The string in OP is appended to string 'L', and the result is
    used with an indirect reference to obtain the final label name.
<P>
      Indirect referencing in the GOTO field is a more powerful version
    of the computed GOTO which appears in some languages.  It
    allows a program to quickly perform a multiway control branch
    based on an item of data.  Of course, the computed label name
    must be defined in the program.  SNOBOL4 provides an error message
    if your program transfers to an undefined label.
<P>
      Indirect referencing may not be used in a statement's label
    field.  Dynamically changing the name of a statement during execution
    is excessive even by SNOBOL4 standards.
<H3><A NAME="5.2">
                       5.2 UNEVALUATED EXPRESSIONS
</A></H3>
<P>
      The pattern data type appears when a pattern structure is
    stored in a variable for subsequent use in a pattern match.  For
    example, a pattern to capture the next N characters after a
    colon, and store them in variable ITEM could be written as:
<PRE>
    NPAT = ':' LEN(N) . ITEM
</PRE>
      Notice that a definition such as this is static.  NPAT captures
    the value of variable N at the time of pattern construction.  If
    we subsequently alter N in the program, NPAT retains N's original
    value.  One way to use the current value of N is to explicitly
    specify the pattern each time it is needed:
<PRE>
    SUBJECT ':' LEN(N) . ITEM
</PRE>
      Now the pattern is being constructed anew whenever the statement
    is executed.  But reconstructing a pattern whenever it is
    used is inefficient, so a one-time definition is preferable.
<P>
      The &quot;unevaluated expression&quot; operator allows us to obtain the
    efficiency of the NPAT formulation, yet use the current value of
    N when NPAT is referenced.  It is a unary operator, whose graphic
    symbol is the asterisk (*).  Now we would specify NPAT like this:
<PRE>
    NPAT = ':' LEN(*N) . ITEM
</PRE>
      The pattern is only constructed once, and assigned to NPAT.
    The current value of N is ignored at this time.  Later, when NPAT
    is used in a pattern match, the unevaluated expression operator
    tells SNOBOL4 to fetch the current value of N.
<P>
      The unevaluated expression operator may be used with the argument
    of the pattern functions ANY, BREAK, LEN, NOTANY, POS, RPOS,
    RTAB, SPAN, or TAB.  It may also be applied to an alternate or
    subsequent clause or to an entire pattern.  Here's an example:
<PRE>
    ?       PAT = TAB(*I) . OUTPUT SPAN(*S) . OUTPUT
    ?       SUB = '123AABBCC'
    ?       I = 4
    ?       S = 'AB'
    ?       SUB PAT
    123A
    ABB
    ?       I = 3
    ?       SUB PAT
    123
    AABB
</PRE>
      It's worth noting that I and S were undefined when PAT was
    first constructed.  Later, we will apply this technique to construct
    recursive patterns.
<H3><A NAME="5.3">
                        5.3 IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT
</A></H3>
<P>
      Our examples have made extensive use of the conditional assignment
    operator to capture matched substrings after a successful
    pattern match.  The &quot;immediate assignment&quot; operator allows us to
    capture intermediate results during the pattern match.
<P>
      Immediate assignment occurs whenever a subpattern matches, even
    if the entire pattern match ultimately fails.  Immediate assignment
    is a binary operator whose graphic symbol is the dollar sign
    ($).  Like conditional assignment, the matching substring on its
    left is assigned to the variable on its right.  Here are examples
    with CODE.SNO where we use variable OUTPUT to reveal the work of
    the pattern matcher:
<PRE>
    ?       S = 'ABCDEFG'
    ?       S 'A' ARB $ OUTPUT 'E'

    B
    BC
    BCD
    Success
    ?       S ('B' LEN(2) | 'C' LEN(3)) $ OUTPUT 'G'
    BCD
    CDEF
    Success
    ?
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="5.3.1">
    5.3.1 Immediate Assignment and Unevaluated Expressions
</A></H3>
<P>
      As useful as immediate assignment is for revealing the inner
    workings of a pattern match, a more powerful use is possible.  It
    can be used with the unevaluated expression operator to develop a
    new class of patterns.  An interesting substring at the beginning
    of the subject is immediately assigned to a variable, and the
    variable is then subsequently used in the very same pattern.
<P>
      Suppose a number at the beginning of the subject specifies the
    length of a variable width field that follows.  We would like to
    capture the number into variable N, then use it with the LEN
    function to transfer the data into variable FIELD.  When used
    with LEN, N must be preceded by the unevaluated expression operator,
    so that its new value is retrieved.  For instance:
<PRE>
    ?       FPAT = SPAN('0123456789') $ N LEN(*N) . FIELD
    ?       '12ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQ' FPAT
    Success
    ?       OUTPUT = FIELD
    ABCDEFGHIJKL
</PRE>
      SPAN matched the field length, 12, and immediately assigned it
    to N.  LEN(*N) then matched the next 12 characters.  Another subject,
    with a different field length, would update N appropriately.
     Type conversion was working quietly behind the scenes
    here:  N was assigned the string '12', yet it appeared as integer
    12 to the LEN function.
<P>
      Now here is an example which provides a glimpse of just how
    powerful SNOBOL4's pattern matching can be.  Problem:  Examine a
    subject for an arbitrary three-character substring which appears
    twice in a row, or bracketed in parentheses.  Solution:
<PRE>
    ?       TWOPAT = LEN(3) $ X . OUTPUT *(X | &quot;(&quot; X &quot;)&quot;)
    ?       'ABCDECDEFGH' TWOPAT
    CDE
    Success
    ?       'ABCDE(CDE)BA' TWOPAT
    CDE
    Success
</PRE>
      As you experiment with these types of patterns, you may discover
    some which fail when they should succeed.  The problem is
    that SNOBOL4 stops matching when it believes further match attempts
    would be futile.  These &quot;heuristics&quot; are normally invisible,
    and speed program execution.  At this time, we'll defer discussing
    heuristics, and simply mention that they can be disabled
    with the statement:
<PRE>
    &amp;FULLSCAN = 1
</PRE>
      Let's take a break from pattern matching, and examine some
    other SNOBOL4 data types.
<H3><A NAME="5.4">
                               5.4 ARRAYS
</A></H3>
<H3><A NAME="5.4.1">
    5.4.1 Array Concepts
</A></H3>
<P>
      Arrays in SNOBOL4 are similar to arrays in other programming
    languages.  They allow a single variable name to specify more
    than one data element; integer subscripts distinguish the individual
    members of an array.  Each array element may contain any
    data type, independent of the types in other array elements.
<P>
      A one-dimensional array is a &quot;vector;&quot; it is simply a list of I
    items.  A two-dimensional array is a &quot;grid&quot; composed of several
    adjacent vectors -- an I by J array has I rows and J columns.  A
    three-dimensional array, I by J by K in size, is a rectangular
    solid consisting of K adjacent grids.  There's no limit to the
    number of dimensions allowed, but such arrays become increasingly
    difficult to visualize.
<P>
      In keeping with SNOBOL4's pliability, an array is defined during
    program execution, rather than at compilation time.  Its size
    and shape is specified by a string.  The definition of an array
    may be changed at any time, or the array may be deleted and its
    memory reused when it is no longer needed.
<H3><A NAME="5.4.2">
    5.4.2 Array Creation
</A></H3>
<P>
      Arrays are created by the SNOBOL4 function ARRAY.  A program
    calls this function with a &quot;prototype string&quot; which specifies the
    number of dimensions and their sizes.  The function returns an
    &quot;array pointer,&quot; which is stored in a variable; the array
    elements are referenced by applying subscripts to this variable.
    Here are two statements for use with CODE.SNO.  They create oneand
    two-dimensional arrays named LIST and BOX respectively:
<PRE>
    ?       LIST = ARRAY('25')
    ?       BOX = ARRAY('12,3')
</PRE>
      LIST points to a vector of 25 elements.  BOX points to a grid,
    12 rows high and 3 columns wide, containing 36 elements.  The
    ARRAY function initializes all array elements to the null string.
<H3><A NAME="5.4.3">
    5.4.3 Array Referencing
</A></H3>
<P>
      Array subscripts are integer valued, and are specified by angular
    or square brackets (&lt;&gt; or []).  Subscript values range from 1
    to the size of each dimension.  If you attempt to use a subscript
    outside this range, the array reference will fail, and the failure
    may be detected in the GOTO portion of the statement.  Try
    some array references with CODE.SNO:
<PRE>
    ?       LIST&lt;3&gt; = 'MAPLE'
    ?       BOX[10,2] = 3
    ?       LIST[33] = 4
    Failure
    ?       OUTPUT = LIST[3] LIST[4] BOX&lt;10,2&gt;
    MAPLE3
</PRE>
      Angular and square brackets are interchangeable.  The reference
    to LIST[33] failed because the largest subscript allowed for that
    array is 25.  LIST[4] produced its initialized value, the null
    string, and had no effect on the concatenation.  The array
    pointer in LIST can be assigned to another variable:
<PRE>
    ?       B = LIST
    ?       OUTPUT = B[3]
    MAPLE
    ?       B&lt;3&gt; = 'WILLOW'
    ?       OUTPUT = LIST&lt;3&gt;
    WILLOW
</PRE>
      Assigning the pointer in LIST to B made both variables point to
    the same array.  Since there's but one actual array, array references
    made using LIST or B are equivalent.  The COPY function
    (see <A HREF="../manual/ch8.htm">Chapter 8 of the Reference Manual</A>) creates a duplicate copy of an entire array.
<P>
      Array elements may be used anywhere a variable name is
    allowed -- expressions, patterns, function arguments, etc.  The
    fact that an array reference fails if a subscript is out-ofbounds
    can be used in a simple and natural way when scanning an
    array.  Rather than having to know an array's size, we simply
    loop until an array reference fails.  A program segment to display
    the members of an array SCORE might look like this:
<PRE>
   I = 0
   I = I + 1
   OUTPUT = SCORE[I]                    :S(PRINT)
   . . .
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="5.4.4">
    5.4.4 Array Initialization
</A></H3>
<P>
      Arrays may be created with an initial value other than the null
    string.  ARRAY accepts a second argument which specifies this
    initial value.  We can create a three-dimensional array with all
    elements initialized to the string 'PA-18' as follows:
<PRE>
    ?       A = ARRAY('2,3,4','PA-18')
    ?       OUTPUT = A[1,2,3]
    PA-18
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="5.4.5">
    5.4.5 Other Array Bounds
</A></H3>
<P>
      Ordinarily, subscripts range from 1 to the size of each dimension.
     However, if you find it more convenient, other subscript
    ranges may be used.  The prototype string for ARRAY's first
    argument has the general form:
<PRE>
    'L1:H1,L2:H3,...,Ln:Hn'
</PRE>
      The L's and H's are integers specifying the lower and upper
    bounds of each dimension.  If the lower bound and colon are
    omitted from any dimension, the integer 1 is assumed.  Here is a
    five element vector, with allowed subscripts -2, -1, 0, 1 and 2:
<PRE>
    ?       A = ARRAY('-2:2','PIPER')
    ?       OUTPUT = A[-1]
    PIPER
    ?       OUTPUT = A[3]
    Failure
</PRE>
      Arrays are a traditional computer programming concept.  Now
    we'll see how SNOBOL4 takes the idea one important step further,
    with the concept of tables.
<H3><A NAME="5.5">
                               5.5 TABLES
</A></H3>
<H3><A NAME="5.5.1">
    5.5.1 Table Creation and Referencing
</A></H3>
<P>
      A &quot;table&quot; is similar to a one-dimensional array, with two
    important differences.  First, a table's size is not fixed; it
    extends itself automatically whenever a new element is added to
    it.  Second, table subscripts are not limited to integers, but
    may be any SNOBOL4 data type.  Strings and patterns may be used
    as subscripts.  Tables combine the idea of associative programming
    with the data grouping of arrays.
<P>
      Tables are created by the SNOBOL4 function TABLE.  No arguments
    are required, since a table's size is not fixed.  The function
    returns a table pointer, which you store in a variable.  Like
    arrays, table elements are referenced by applying subscripts to
    the variable.  Try this example with CODE.SNO:
<PRE>
    ?       T = TABLE()
    ?       T['ROSE'] = 'RED'
    ?       T['N'] = 6
    ?       OUTPUT = T['N'] T['THE'] T['ROSE']
    6RED
    ?       FLOWER = 'ROSE'
    ?       T[FLOWER] = T[FLOWER] ',THORNS'
    ?       OUTPUT = T[FLOWER]
    RED,THORNS
</PRE>
      Here, strings have been used as table subscripts.  The concept
    of an &quot;out-of-bounds&quot; subscript does not exist with tables.  The
    reference to T['THE'] created a new entry, and assigned it the
    null string.  Unlike arrays, no initial value for new entries may
    be specified in the call to TABLE; new table entries are always
    initialized to the null string.
<H3><A NAME="5.5.2">
    5.5.2 Conversion between Tables and Arrays

<P>
      In the above example, we know what values were used as table
    subscripts.  But if the table were constructed from data in a
    file, how can we determine what items were placed in the table?
    We need to know the subscripts to view the table, but the subscripts
    themselves are part of the table.  If this were an array,
    we could run an integer subscript over the array to see the data.
    Applying integer subscripts to a table only creates more entries.
<P>
      SNOBOL4 provides a simple solution to this dilemma -- a method
    to convert a table to an array.  An N row by 2 column array can
    be created from a table.  The first array column contains the
    subscripts that were used to create the table.  The second column
    contains the data items stored with the corresponding table subscript.
     N is the number of table entries with nonnull values.
<P>
      Once the table is in array form, integer subscripts can be
    applied to the array to display the subscripts and their values.
    A table is converted to an array with the CONVERT function, which
    accepts a table argument and the word 'ARRAY', and returns a
    pointer to the new array.  Continuing with the previous example:
<PRE>
    ?       A = CONVERT(T, 'ARRAY')
    Success
    ?       OUTPUT = A[1,1] '-' A[1,2]
    ROSE-RED,THORNS
    ?       OUTPUT = A[2,1] '-' A[2,2]
    N-6
</PRE>
      As you would expect with SNOBOL4, the inverse operation -- conversion
    of an array to a table -- is also possible.  The array
    must be rectangular, N rows by 2 columns.  The array entries in
    the first column become the table subscripts.  The array's second
    column becomes the table entry values:
<PRE>
    ?       W = CONVERT(A, 'TABLE')
    Success
    ?       OUTPUT = W['ROSE']
    RED,THORNS

    5.5.3 Counting Word Usage with a Table
</A></H3>
<P>
      Tables are useful when we want to record a number of pair associations,
    where each half of the pair might have any data type.
    A classic example of a table's utility is a word usage program.
    Earlier, we developed a program to count the total number of
    words in a file.  We will modify that program to count the number
    of times each unique word appears.  The program begins like this:
<PRE>
    *       Simple word usage program, WORDU.SNO.
    *
    *  A word is defined to be a contiguous run of letters,
    *  digits, apostrophe and hyphen.  This definition of legal
    *  letters in a word can be altered for specialized text.
    *
    *  If the file to be counted is TEXT.IN, run as follows:
    *       B&gt;SNOBOL4 WORDU /I=TEXT
    *
            &amp;TRIM  = 1

    *  Define the characters which comprise a 'word'
            WORD   = &quot;'-&quot;  '0123456789' &amp;LCASE

    *  Pattern to isolate each word as assign it to ITEM:
            WPAT   = BREAK(WORD) SPAN(WORD) . ITEM

    *  Create a table to maintain the word counts
            WCOUNT = TABLE()

    *  Read a line of input and obtain the next word
    NEXTL   LINE   = REPLACE(INPUT, &amp;UCASE, &amp;LCASE)   :F(DONE)
    NEXTW   LINE WPAT =                               :F(NEXTL)

    *  Use word as subscript, update its usage count
            WCOUNT&lt;ITEM&gt; = WCOUNT&lt;ITEM&gt; + 1           :(NEXTW)
    DONE     . . .
</PRE>
      We'll convert the input to lower case, so words like 'The' and
    'the' are counted together.  WPAT has been changed to store each
    word in variable ITEM.  When a word is identified, it is used as
    a subscript for table WCOUNT.  When ITEM contains a new word, the
    first reference to WCOUNT&lt;ITEM&gt; creates a new table entry and
    returns the null string.  Integer 1 is added to the null string,
    and the result, 1, is stored back into WCOUNT&lt;ITEM&gt;.  If the same
    word is encountered again, WCOUNT&lt;ITEM&gt; for that word will be
    incremented to 2.
<P>
      The program reads the input file, building a table with entries
    for each unique word.  When End-of-File is read, control transfers
    to label DONE, where we display the words and their respective
    counts.  We convert WCOUNT to an array, and use integer
    subscripts to retrieve the words and their counts.  Conversion
    fails if the table is empty.  Continuing with this program:
<PRE>
    *  Convert table to array.  Fail if table is empty
    DONE    A = CONVERT(WCOUNT, 'ARRAY')              :F(EMPTY)

    *  Scan array, printing words and counts
            I = 0
    PRINT   I = I + 1
            OUTPUT = A&lt;I,1&gt; '--' A&lt;I,2&gt;     :S(PRINT) F(END)

    EMPTY   OUTPUT = 'No words'
    END
</PRE>
      The table subscripts were the file's words, and have been
    placed in the first column of the array, A&lt;I,1&gt;.  The count for
    each word was the table entry, now in the second column, A&lt;I,2&gt;.
    Tables are very convenient for recording information about data
    items, while conversion to an array makes it easy to systematically
    examine the recorded information.
<H3><A NAME="5.6">
                          5.6 THE NAME OPERATOR
</A></H3>
<P>
      The unary name operator provides the address or location in
    memory where a variable is stored.  Its graphic symbol is the
    period (.).  We'll introduce it here through an example.
<P>
      Consider the indirect reference operator mentioned earlier.
    Suppose we want to use a variable to point to different elements
    of an array or table.  If we try the following, we immediately
    discover a problem:
<PRE>
    ?       A = ARRAY('10,10')
    ?       A[4,2] = 'DOG'
    ?       V = 'A[4,2]'
    ?       OUTPUT = $V
</PRE>
         Success
<P>
      The indirect reference operator treats the string 'A[4,2]' as a
    variable name, rather than an array element.  Remember, any character
    sequence can be used indirectly to create a variable.
    SNOBOL4 creates a variable called A[4,2] that has absolutely no
    connection with array A.  The fact that this character sequence
    happens to look like an array reference to us is purely coincidental
    from SNOBOL4's point of view.
<P>
      To make this work, the name operator is applied to A[4,2] to
    obtain the address of that array element.  The address can be
    stored in variable V, and referenced with the indirect operator:
<PRE>
    ?       V = .A[4,2]
    ?       OUTPUT = $V
    DOG
</PRE>
      The name operator provides a general method for specifying the
    name of an object.  Both of these statements are correct for
    specifying the first argument to the INPUT function:
<PRE>
    INPUT('INFILE', 1, , 'CAPITAL.DAT')
    INPUT(.INFILE,  1, , 'CAPITAL.DAT')
</PRE>
      Either form, 'INFILE' or .INFILE, tells the INPUT function the
    name of the variable to be input associated.  However, using the
    name operator allows us to associate a file with an array or
    table element:
<PRE>
    INPUT('A[4,2]', 1, , 'CAPITAL.DAT')  (incorrect)
    INPUT(.A[4,2],  1, , 'CAPITAL.DAT')
</PRE>
      Note that alternate use of the indirect reference and name
    operators &quot;cancel&quot; one another, so
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = $(.($(.A[4,2])))
    DOG
</PRE>
    is simply a reference to A[4,2].
