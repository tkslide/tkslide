<H2>Chapter 1 : FUNDAMENTALS</H2>
      SNOBOL4 is really a combination of two kinds of languages:  a
    conventional language, with several data types and a simple but
    powerful control structure, and a pattern language, with a structure
    all its own.  The conventional language is not block structured,
    and may appear old-fashioned.  The pattern language,
    however, remains unsurpassed, and is unique to SNOBOL4.
<P>
      You should try to master the conventional portion of SNOBOL4
    first.  When you're comfortable with it, you can move on to pattern
    matching.  Pattern matching by itself is a very large subject,
    and this manual can only offer an introduction.  The sample
    programs accompanying Vanilla SNOBOL4, as well as the many
    SNOBOL4 books available from Catspaw can be studied for a deeper
    understanding of patterns and their application.
<P>
      We'll begin by discussing data types, operators, and variables.
<H3><A NAME="1.1">
                          1.1 SIMPLE DATA TYPES
</A></H3>
      SNOBOL4 has several different basic types, but has a mechanism
    to define hundreds more as aggregates of others.  Initially,
    we'll discuss the two most basic:  integers and strings.
<H3><A NAME="1.1.1">
    1.1.1 Integers
</A></H3>
      An integer is a simple whole number, without a fractional part.
    In SNOBOL4, its value can range from -32767 to +32767.  It appears
    without quotation marks, and commas should not be used to
    group digits.  Here are some acceptable integers:
<PRE>
    14    -234    0    0012    +12832    -9395    +0
</PRE>
      These are incorrect in SNOBOL4:
<PRE>
    13.4             fractional part is not allowed
    49723            larger than 32767
    -                number must contain at least one digit
    3,076            comma is not allowed
</PRE>
      Use the CODE.SNO program to test different integer values.  Try
    both legal and illegal values.  Here are some sample test lines:
<PRE>
    Enter SNOBOL4 statements:
    ?       OUTPUT = 42
    42
    ?       OUTPUT = -825
    -825
    ?       OUTPUT = 73768
    Compilation error: Erroneous integer, re-enter:
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="1.1.2">
    1.1.2 Reals
</A></H3>
      Vanilla SNOBOL4 does not include real numbers.  They are
    available in SNOBOL4+, Catspaw's highly enhanced implementation
    of the SNOBOL4 programming language.
<H3><A NAME="1.1.3">
    1.1.3 Strings
</A></H3>
      A string is an ordered sequence of characters.  The order of
    the characters is important: the strings AB and BA are different.
    Characters are not restricted to printing characters; all of the
    256 combinations possible in an 8-bit byte are allowed.
<P>
      Normally, the maximum length of a string is 5,000 characters,
    although you can tell SNOBOL4 to accept longer strings.  A string
    of length zero (no characters) is called the null string.  At
    first, you may find the idea of an empty string disturbing:  it's
    a string, but it has no characters.  Its role in SNOBOL4 is similar
    to the role of zero in the natural number system.
<P>
      Strings may appear literally in your program, or may be created
    during execution.  To place a literal string in your program, enclose
    it in apostrophes (')<A HREF="#F1" NAME="R1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> or double quotation marks (&quot;).
    Either may be used, but the beginning and ending marks must be
    the same. The string itself may contain one type of mark if the
    other is used to enclose the string.  The null string is represented
    by two successive marks, with no intervening characters.
    Here are some samples to try with CODE.SNO:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = 'STRING LITERAL'
    STRING LITERAL
    ?       OUTPUT = &quot;So is this&quot;
    So is this
    ?       OUTPUT = ''

    ?       OUTPUT = 'WHO COINED THE WORD &quot;BYTE&quot;?'
    WHO COINED THE WORD &quot;BYTE&quot;?
    ?       OUTPUT = &quot;WON'T&quot;
    WON'T
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="1.2">
                          1.2 SIMPLE OPERATORS
</A></H3>
      If data is the raw material, operators are the tools that do
    the work.  Some operators, such as + and -, appear in all programming
    languages, and pocket calculators.  But SNOBOL4 provides
    many more, some of which are unique to the SNOBOL4 language.
    SNOBOL4 also allows you to define your own operators.  We'll
    examine just a few basic operators below.
<H3><A NAME="1.2.1">
    1.2.1 Unary vs. Binary
</A></H3>
<P>
      SNOBOL4 operators require either one or two items of data,
    called operands.  For example, the minus sign (-) can be used
    with one object.  In this form, the operator is considered unary:
<PRE>
    -6
</PRE>
    or as a binary operator with two operands:
<PRE>
    4 - 1
</PRE>
      In the first case, the minus sign negates the number.  The second
    example subtracts 1 from 4.  The minus sign's meaning depends
    on the context in which it appears.  SNOBOL4 has a very simple
    rule for determining if an operator is binary or unary:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
         Unary operators are placed immediately to the left of
         their operand.  No blank or tab character may appear
         between operator and operand.
<P>
         Binary operators have one or more blank or tab characters
    on each side.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
      The blank or tab requirement for binary operators causes problems
    for programmers first learning SNOBOL4.  Most other languages
    make these white space characters optional.  Omitting the
    right hand blank after a binary operator will produce a unary
    operator, and while the statement may be syntactically correct,
    it will probably produce unexpected results.  Fortunately, blanks
    and binary operators quickly become a way of SNOBOL4 life, and
    after some initial forgetfulness there are few problems.
<H3><A NAME="1.2.2">
    1.2.2 Some Binary Operators
</A></H3>
<PRE>
    Operation:     Assignment
    Symbol:        = (equals sign)
</PRE>
      You've already met one binary operator, the equals sign (=).
    It appeared in the first sample program:
<PRE>
    OUTPUT = 'Hello world!'
</PRE>
      It assigns, or transfers, the value of the object on the right
    ('Hello world!') to the object on the left (variable OUTPUT).
<PRE>
    Operation:     Arithmetic
    Symbols:       **, *, /, +, -
</PRE>
      These characters provide the arithmetic operations -- exponentiation,
    multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction
    respectively.  Each is assigned a priority, so SNOBOL4 knows
    which to perform first if more than one appear in an expression.
    Exponentiation is performed first, followed by multiplication,
    division, and finally addition and subtraction.  SNOBOL4 is
    unusual in giving multiplication higher priority than division;
    most programming languages treat them equally.
<P>
      You may use parentheses to change the order of operations.
    Division of an integer by another integer will produce a truncated
    integer result; the fractional result is discarded.  Try
    the following:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = 3 - 6 + 2
    -1
    ?       OUTPUT = 2 * (10 + 4)
    28
    ?       OUTPUT = 7 / 4
    1
    ?       OUTPUT = 3 ** 5
    243
    ?       OUTPUT = 10 / 2 * 5
    1
    ?       OUTPUT = (10 / 2) * 5
    25
</PRE>
      When the same operator occurs more than once in an expression,
    which one should be performed first?  The governing principle is
    called associativity, and is either left or right.  Multiple
    instances of *, /, + and - are performed left to right, while
    **'s are performed right to left.  Again, parentheses may be used
    to change the default order.  Try a few examples:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = 24 / 4 / 2
    3
    ?       OUTPUT = 24 / (4 / 2)
    12
    ?       OUTPUT = 2 ** 2 ** 3
    256
    ?       OUTPUT = (2 ** 2) ** 3
    64
</PRE>
      Here's the first bit of SNOBOL4 magic: what happens if either
    operand is a string rather than an integer or real number?  The
    action taken is one which is widespread throughout the SNOBOL4
    language; the system tries to convert the operand to a suitable
    data type.  Given the statement
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = 14 + '54'
    68
</PRE>
    SNOBOL4 detects the addition of an integer and a string, and
    tries to convert the string to a numeric value.  Here the conversion
    succeeds, and the integers 14 and 54 are added together.  If
    the characters in the string do not form an acceptable integer,
    SNOBOL4 produces the error message &quot;Illegal data type.&quot;
<P>
      SNOBOL4 is strict about the composition of strings being converted
    to numeric values: leading or trailing blanks or tabs are
    not allowed.  The null string is permitted, and converted to
    integer 0.  Try producing some arithmetic errors:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = 14 + ' 54'
    Execution error #1, Illegal data type
    Failure
    ?       OUTPUT = 'A' + 1
    Execution error #1, Illegal data type
    Failure
</PRE>
    Note:  Error numbers are listed in <A HREF="../manual/ch9.htm">Chapter 9
    of the Reference Manual</A>,
     &quot;System Messages.&quot;
<PRE>
    Operation:     Concatenation
    Symbols:       blank or tab
</PRE>
      This is the fundamental operator for assembling strings.  Two
    strings are concatenated simply by writing one after the other,
    with one or more blank or tab characters between them.  There is
    no explicit symbol for concatenation (it is special in this
    regard), the white space between two objects serves to define
    this operator.  The blank or tab character merely specifies the
    operation; it is not included in the resulting string.
<P>
      The string that results from concatenation is the right string
    appended to the end of the left.  The two strings remain
    unchanged and a third string emerges as the result.  Try a few
    simple concatenations with CODE.SNO:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = 'CONCAT' 'ENATION'
    CONCATENATION
    ?       OUTPUT = 'ONE,' 'TWO,' 'THREE'
    ONE,TWO,THREE
    ?       OUTPUT = 'A'                 'B'       'C'
    ABC
    ?       OUTPUT = 'BEGINNING '   'AND '   'END.'
    BEGINNING AND END.
</PRE>
      The string resulting from concatenation can not be longer than
    the maximum allowable string size.
<P>
      The concatenation operator works only on character strings, but
    if an operand is not a string, SNOBOL4 will convert it to its
    string form.  For example,
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = (20 - 17)  ' DOG NIGHT'
    3 DOG NIGHT
    ?       OUTPUT = 19  (12 / 3)
    194
</PRE>
      In the first case, concatenation's right operand is the string
    ' DOG NIGHT', but the left operand is an integer expression
    (20 - 17).  SNOBOL4 performs the subtraction, converts the result
    to the string '3', and produces the final result '3 DOG NIGHT'.
    In the second example, the integer operands are converted to the
    strings '19' and '4', to produce the result string '194'.  This
    is not exactly good math, but it is correct concatenation.
<P>
      You must be careful however.  If you accidentally omit an
    operator, SNOBOL4 will think you intended to perform concatenation.
     In the example above, perhaps we omitted a minus sign and
    had really meant to say:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = 19 - (12 / 3)
    15
</PRE>
      It is always possible for concatenation to automatically convert
    a number to a string.  But there is one important exception
    when SNOBOL4 doesn't try to do this: if either operand is the
    null string, the other operand is returned unchanged.  It is not
    coerced into the string data type.  If the first example were
    changed to:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = (20 - 17)  ''
    3
</PRE>
    the result is the INTEGER 3.  You'll find you'll use this aspect
    of null string concatenations extensively in your SNOBOL4 programming.
<P>
               Before we proceed, let's think about the null string one more
    time as the string equivalent of the number zero.  First of all,
    adding zero to a number does not change its value, and concatenating
    the null string with an object doesn't change it, either.
    Second, just as a calculator is cleared to zero before adding a
    series of numbers, the null string can serve as the starting
    place for concatenating a series of strings.
<H3><A NAME="1.2.3">
    1.2.3 Some Unary Operators
</A></H3>
<P>
      There aren't many interesting unary operators at this point in
    your tour of SNOBOL4.  Most of them appear in connection with
    pattern matching, discussed later.  Note, however, that all unary
    operations are performed before binary operations, unless precedence
    is altered by parentheses.
<PRE>
    Operation:     Arithmetic
    Symbols:       +, -
</PRE>
      These unary operators require a single numeric operand, which
    must immediately follow the operator, without an intervening
    blank or tab.  Unary minus (-) changes the arithmetic sign of its
    operand; unary plus (+) leaves the sign unchanged.  If the
    operand is a string, SNOBOL4 will try to convert it to a number.
    The null string is converted to integer 0.  Coercing a string to
    a number with unary plus is a noteworthy technique.  Try unary
    plus and minus with CODE.SNO:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = -(3 * 5)
    -15
    ?       OUTPUT = +''
    0
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="1.3">
                              1.3 VARIABLES
</A></H3>
<P>
      A variable is a place to store an item of data.  The number of
    variables you may have is unlimited, provided you give each one a
    unique name.  Think of a variable as a box, marked on the outside
    with a permanent name, able to hold any data value or type.  Many
    programming languages require that you formally declare what kind
    of entity the box will contain -- integer, real, string, etc. -- 
    but SNOBOL4 is more flexible.  A variable's contents may change
    repeatedly during program execution.  The size of the box contracts
    or expands as necessary.  One moment it might contain an
    integer, then a 2,000 character string, then the null string; in
    fact, any SNOBOL4 data type.
<P>
      There are only a few rules about composing a variable's name
    when it appears in your program:
<OL>
      <LI>The name must begin with an upper- or lower-case letter.
<P>
      <LI>If it is more than one character long, the remaining characters
    may be any combination of letters, numbers, or the
         characters period (.) and underscore (_).
<P>
      <LI>The name may not be longer than the maximum line length (120
         characters).
</OL><P>
      Here are some correct SNOBOL4 names:
<PRE>
    WAGER     P23     VerbClause     SUM.OF.SQUARES     Buffer
</PRE>
      Normally, SNOBOL4 performs &quot;case-folding&quot; on names.  Lower-case
    alphabetic characters are changed to upper-case when they appear
    in names -- Buffer and BUFFER are equivalent.  Naturally, casefolding
    of data does not occur within a string literal.  Casefolding
    can be disabled by the command line option /C.
<P>
      In some languages, the initial value of a new variable is
    undefined.  SNOBOL4 guarantees that a new variable's initial
    value is the null string.  However, except in very small programs,
    you should always initialize variables.  This prevents
    unexpected results when a program is modified or a program segment
    is reexecuted.
<P>
      You store something in a variable by making it the object of an
    assignment operation.  You can retrieve its contents simply by
    using it wherever its value is needed.  Using a variable's value
    is nondestructive; the value in the box remains unchanged.  Try
    creating some variables using CODE.SNO:
<PRE>
    ?       ABC = 'EGG'
    ?       OUTPUT = ABC
    EGG
    ?       D = 'SHELL'
    ?       OUTPUT = abc d             (Same as ABC D)
    EGGSHELL
    ?       OUTPUT = NONESUCH          (New variable is null)
     
    ?       OUTPUT = ABC NULL D
    EGGSHELL
    ?       N1 = 43
    ?       D = 17
    ?       OUTPUT = N1 + D
    60
    ?       output = ABC D
    EGG17
</PRE>
      OUTPUT is a variable with special properties; when a value is
    stored in its box, it is also displayed on your screen.  There is
    a corresponding variable named INPUT, which reads data from your
    keyboard.  Its box has no permanent contents.  Whenever SNOBOL4
    is asked to fetch its value, a complete line is read from the
    keyboard and used instead.  If INPUT were used twice in one
    statement, two separate lines of input would be read.  Try these
    examples:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = INPUT
    TYPE ANYTHING YOU DESIRE
    TYPE ANYTHING YOU DESIRE
    ?       TWO.LINES = INPUT '-AND-' INPUT
    FIRST LINE
    SECOND LINE
    ?       OUTPUT = TWO.LINES
    FIRST LINE-AND-SECOND LINE
</PRE>
      SNOBOL4 variables are global in scope -- any variable may be
    referenced anywhere in the program.
