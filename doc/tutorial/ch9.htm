<H2>Chapter 9 : CONCLUDING REMARKS</H2>
<P>
      For much of this tutorial we've been concerned with the detailed
    mechanics of pattern matching -- the functions, primitive
    patterns, and heuristics of applying a pattern to a character
    string.  SNOBOL4 provides so many primitive functions and operations
    that it's easy to get lost in the forest.  Let's step back
    and consider SNOBOL4's larger significance.
<P>
      It would be a mistake to think of SNOBOL4 only as a text processing
    language.  For example, programmers in the artificial
    intelligence field think in terms of lists, and have used the
    LISP language for some time.  As Shafto demonstrates, SNOBOL4 can
    be made to emulate LISP, and go well beyond it, using pattern
    matching, backtracking, and associative programming (see file
    SNOBOL4.DOC for information on Shafto's report on AI SNOBOL4
    programming.)
<P>
      SNOBOL4's pattern matching provides a very powerful and completely
    general recognition system, in which character strings
    happen to be the medium of expression.  Other recognition problems
    can be solved by mapping the object to be examined into a
    subject string, and the recognition criteria into SNOBOL4
    patterns.
<P>
      In the past, use of SNOBOL4 has been hindered by the high cost
    and inconvenience of running it on mainframe computers.  Now it's
    on your desk top, with computer time essentially free.
<P>
      What new insights can SNOBOL4 bring to your problems?  Can you
    find other general applications for SNOBOL4's unique abilities?
<P>
      The future of the language is in your hands.
