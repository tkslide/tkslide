<H2>Chapter 8 : DEBUGGING AND PROGRAM EFFICIENCY</H2>
<H3><A NAME="8.1">
                       8.1 DEBUGGING AND TRACING
</A></H3>
<P>
      You are probably well aware of the diversity of potential errors
    when writing computer programs.  They range from simple
    typographical errors made while entering a program, to subtle design
    problems which may only be revealed by unexpected input
    data.
<P>
      Debugging a SNOBOL4 program is not fundamentally different than
    debugging programs written in other languages.  However,
    SNOBOL4's syntactic flexibility and lack of type declarations for
    variables produce some unexpected problems.  By way of compensation,
    an unusually powerful trace capability is provided.
<P>
      Of course, there may come a time when you can't explain your
    program's behavior, and decide &quot;the system&quot; is at fault.  No
    guarantee can ever be made that SNOBOL4 is completely free of
    errors.  However, its internal algorithms have been in use in
    other SNOBOL4 systems since 1967, and all known errors have been
    removed.  Often the problem is a misunderstanding of how a function
    works with exceptional data, and a close reading of the reference
    section clears the problem up.  In short, suspect the
    system last.
<H3><A NAME="8.1.1">
    8.1.1 Compilation Errors
</A></H3>
<P>
      Compilation errors are the simplest to find; SNOBOL4 displays
    the erroneous line on your screen with its statement number, and
    places a marker below the point where the error was encountered.
    The source file name, line number, and column number of the error
    are displayed for use by your text editor.  Only the first error
    in a statement is identified, so you should also carefully check
    the remainder of the statement.  A typical line looks like this:
<PRE>
    32              ,OUTPUT = CNT+ 1
                     ^
    test.sno(57,10) : Compilation Error : Erroneous statement
</PRE>
      Here, the comma preceding the word OUTPUT is misplaced.  The
    message indicates that &quot;,OUTPUT&quot; is not a valid language element.
<P>
      Programs containing compilation errors can still be run, at
    least until a statement containing an error is encountered.  When
    that happens, SNOBOL4 will produce an execution error message,
    and stop.
<P>
      A complete description of error messages is provided in <A HREF="../manual/ch9.htm">Chapter
    9 of the Reference Manual</A>, &quot;System Messages.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="8.1.2">
    8.1.2 Execution Errors
</A></H3>
<P>
      Once a program compiles without error, testing can begin.  Two
    kinds of errors are possible: SNOBOL4 detectable errors, such an
    incorrect data type or calling an undefined function, and program
    logic errors that produce incorrect results.
<P>
      With the first type of error, you'll get a SNOBOL4 error message
    with statement and line numbers.  Inspecting the offending
    line will often reveal typing errors, such as a misspelled function
    name, keyword, or label.  If the error is due to incorrect
    data in a variable -- such as trying to perform arithmetic on a
    non-numeric string -- you'll have to start debugging to discover
    how the incorrect data was created.  Placing output statements in
    your program, or using the trace techniques described below, will
    usually find such errors.
<P>
      Here are some common errors to look for first:
<OL>
      <LI>Setting keywords &amp;ANCHOR, &amp;FULLSCAN, and &amp;TRIM improperly.
         We may have written a program with anchored pattern matching
         in mind, but let an unanchored match slip in inadvertently.
         Forgetting to set &amp;TRIM to 1 causes blanks to be appended to
         input lines, and they usually interfere with pattern matching
    and conversion of a string to an integer.
<P>
      <LI>Misspelled variable names.  Using PUTPUT instead of OUTPUT,
         as in:
<PRE>
    PUTPUT = LINE1
</PRE>
         creates a new variable and assigns LINE1 to it.  Worse still
         is using a misspelled name as a value source, since it will
         return a null string value.
<P>
         The first type of error is relatively easy to find -- produce
         an end-of-run dump by using the SNOBOL4 command line option
         /D.  You can study the list of variables for an unexpected
         name.  The second type of error is naturally much harder to
         find, because variables with null string values are omitted
         from the end-of-run dump.  In this case, you will have to
         study the source program closely for misspellings.
<P>
      <LI>Spurious spaces between a function name and its argument
         list.  A line like:
<PRE>
    LINE = TRIM (INPUT)
</PRE>
         is not a call to the TRIM function.  The blank between TRIM
         and the left parenthesis is interpreted as concatenating
<P>
         variable TRIM with the expression (INPUT).  TRIM used as a
         variable is likely to be the null string, so INPUT is
         returned unchanged.
<P>
      <LI>No blank space after a binary operator.   SNOBOL4 sees a
         unary operator instead, with completely unexpected results.
         For instance:
<PRE>
    X = Y -Z
</PRE>
         concatenates Y with the expression -Z.
<P>
      <LI>Confusion occurring when a variable contains a number in
         string form.  When used as an argument to most functions,
         conversion from string to number is automatic, and proper
         execution results.  However, functions IDENT and DIFFER do
         not convert their arguments, and seemingly equal values are
         thought to be different.  For example, if we want to test an
         input line for the number 3, the statements:
<PRE>
    N = INPUT
    IDENT(N, 3)                               :S(OK)
</PRE>
         are not correct.  N contains a string, which is a different
         data type from the integer 3.  This could be corrected by
         using IDENT(+N, 3), or EQ(N, 3).  Once again, &amp;TRIM should
         be 1, or the blanks appended to N will prevent its conversion
    to an integer.
<P>
      <LI>Omitting the assignment operator when we wish to remove the
         matching substring from a subject, resulting in a program
         which loops forever.  For example, our word-counting program
         replaced each word with the null string:
<PRE>
    NEXTWRD LINE WRDPAT =                        :F(READ)
</PRE>
         However, by omitting the equal sign we would repeatedly find
         the same first word in LINE:
<PRE>
    NEXTWRD LINE WRDPAT                          :F(READ)
</PRE>
      <LI>Unexpected statement failure, with no provision for detecting
    it in the GOTO field.  For example, the CONVERT function
         fails if the table being converted is empty:
<PRE>
    RESULT = CONVERT(TALLY, &quot;ARRAY&quot;)
</PRE>
         RESULT will not be set if CONVERT fails, and a subsequent
         array reference to RESULT would produce an execution error.
<P>
      <LI>Failure can be detected but misinterpreted when there are
         several causes for it in a statement.  This statement fails
         when an End-of-File is read, or if the input line does not
         contain any digits:
<PRE>
    INPUT SPAN('0123456789') . N         :F(EOF)
</PRE>
         In the latter case, if we want to generate an error message,
         the statement should be split in two:
<PRE>
    N = INPUT                            :F(EOF)
    N SPAN('0123456789') . N             :F(WARN)
</PRE>
      <LI>Using operators such as alternation (|) and conditional assignment
    (.) for purposes other than pattern construction.
         Using them in the subject field will produce an 'Illegal
         data type' error message.  Using them in the replacement
         field produces a pattern, intended for subsequent use in a
         pattern match statement.  For example, this statement sets N
         to a pattern; it does not replace it with the words 'EVEN'
         or 'ODD', as was probably intended:
<PRE>
    N = EQ(REMDR(N,2),0) 'EVEN' | 'ODD'
</PRE>
         We note in passing that SNOBOL4+, Catspaw's professional
         SNOBOL4 package, provides language extensions that allow
         just that:
<PRE>
    N = (EQ(REMDR(N,2),0) 'EVEN', 'ODD')
</PRE>
      <LI>Forgetting that functions like TAB and BREAK bind subject
         characters.  This won't matter for simple pattern matching,
         but for matching with replacement, problems can appear.  For
         example, suppose we wanted to replace the 50th character in
         string S with '*'.  If we used:
<PRE>
    S TAB(49) LEN(1) = '*'
</PRE>
         we would find the first 50 characters replaced by a single
         asterisk.  Instead, we should say:
<PRE>
    S POS(49) LEN(1) = '*'
</PRE>
         or, even more efficiently:
<PRE>
    S TAB(49) . FRONT LEN(1) = FRONT '*'
</PRE>
      <LI>Omitting the unevaluated expression operator when defining a
         pattern containing variable arguments.  For example, the
         pattern
<PRE>
    NTH_CHAR = POS(*N - 1) LEN(1) . CHAR
</PRE>
         will copy the Nth subject character to variable CHAR.  The
         pattern adjusts automatically if N's value is subsequently
         changed.  Omitting the asterisk would capture the value of N
         at the time the pattern is defined (probably the null
         string).

    8.1.3 Simple Debugging
</A></H3>
<P>
      These simple methods should find a majority of your bugs:
<OL>
      <LI>Set keyword &amp;DUMP nonzero, or use command line option /D to
         get an end-of-run dump.  Examine it closely for reasonable
         values and variable names.  Dumps can also be produced at
         any time during execution by calling the built-in function
         DUMP.
<P>
      <LI>Use keyword &amp;STLIMIT to end execution after a fixed number
         of statements.
<P>
      <LI>Use the keyboard Control-C key to interrupt a program which
         is looping endlessly, and record the statement number.
<P>
      <LI>Use the GOTO :F(ERROR) to detect unexpected failures and
         data errors.  Do not define the label ERROR -- SNOBOL4 will
         display the statement number of the error if an attempt is
         made to transfer to label ERROR.
<P>
      <LI>Assign values to OUTPUT to monitor data values.  Use immediate
    assignment and cursor assignment (to OUTPUT) to observe
         the operation of a pattern match.
<P>
      <LI>Produce end-of-run statistics with the command line option
         /S.  Are the number and kind of operations reasonable?
<P>
      <LI>Use the CODE.SNO program to setup simple test cases.  This
         is particularly useful when pattern-matching statements do
         not behave as expected.
</OL><P>
      More subtle errors can be pinpointed using SNOBOL4's trace facility,
    described below.
<H3><A NAME="8.2">
                         8.2 EXECUTION TRACING
</A></H3>
<P>
      Tracing the flow of control and data in a program is usually
    the best way to find difficult problems.  SNOBOL4 allows tracing
    of data in variables and some keywords, transfers of control to
    specified labels, and function calls and returns.  Two keywords
    control tracing: &amp;FTRACE and &amp;TRACE.
<H3><A NAME="8.2.1">
    8.2.1 Function Tracing
</A></H3>
<P>
      Keyword &amp;FTRACE is set nonzero to produce a trace message each
    time a program-defined function is called or returns.  The trace
    message displays the statement number where the action occurred,
    the name of the function, and the values of its arguments.  Function
    returns display the type of return and value, if any.  Each
    trace message decrements &amp;FTRACE by one, and tracing ends when
    &amp;FTRACE reaches zero.  A typical trace messages looks like this:
<PRE>
    STATEMENT 39: LEVEL 0 CALL OF SHIFT('SKYBLUE',3),TIME = 140
    STATEMENT 12: LEVEL 1 RETURN OF SHIFT = 'BLUESKY',TIME = 141
</PRE>
      The level number is the overall function call depth.  The program
    execution time in tenths of a second is also provided.
<H3><A NAME="8.2.2">
    8.2.2 Selective Tracing
</A></H3>
<P>
      Keyword &amp;TRACE will also produce trace messages when it is set
    nonzero.  However, the TRACE function must be called to specify
    what is to be traced.  Tracing can be selectively ended by using
    the STOPTR function.  The TRACE function call takes the form:
<PRE>
    TRACE(name, type, string, function)
</PRE>
      The name of the item being traced is specified using a string
    or the unary name operator.  Besides variables, it is also possible
    to trace a particular element of an array or table:
<PRE>
    TRACE('VAR1', ...
    TRACE(.A&lt;2,5&gt;, ...
    TRACE('SHIFT', ...
</PRE>
      &quot;Type&quot; is a string describing the kind of trace to be performed.
     If omitted, a VALUE trace is assumed:
<TABLE CELLPADDING=5>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
       <TD><B>'VALUE'</B>          <TD>Trace whenever name has a value assigned to
                        it.  Assignment statements, as well as conditional
                        and immediate assignments within pattern
                        matching will all produce trace messages.
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
       <TD><B>'CALL'</B>           <TD>Produce a trace whenever function name is
                        called.
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
       <TD><B>'RETURN'</B>         <TD>Produce a trace whenever function name
                        returns.
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
       <TD><B>'FUNCTION'</B>       <TD>Combine the previous two types: trace both
                        calls and returns of function name.
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
       <TD><B>'LABEL'</B>          <TD>Produce a trace when a GOTO transfer to
                        statement name occurs.  Flowing sequentially
                        into the labeled statement does not produce a
                        trace.
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
       <TD><B>'KEYWORD'</B>        <TD>Produce a trace when keyword name's value is
                        changed by the system.  The name is specified
                        without an ampersand.  Only keywords
                        &amp;ERRTYPE, &amp;FNCLEVEL, &amp;STCOUNT, and &amp;STFCOUNT
                        may be traced.
</TABLE>
      When the first argument is specified with the unary name operator,
    the third argument, string, will be displayed to identify
    the item being traced:
<PRE>
    TRACE(.T&lt;&quot;zip&quot;&gt;, &quot;VALUE&quot;, &quot;Table entry 'zip'&quot;)
</PRE>
      The last argument, function, is usually omitted.  Its use is
    described in the next section.
<P>
      The form of trace message displayed for each type of trace is
    listed in <A HREF="../manual/ch9.htm">Chapter 9 of the Reference Manual</A>, &quot;System Messages.&quot;
<P>
      Each time a trace is performed, keyword &amp;TRACE is decreased by
    one.  Tracing stops when it reaches zero.  Tracing of a particular
    item can also be stopped by function STOPTR:
<PRE>
    STOPTR(name, type)
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="8.2.4">
    8.2.4 Program Trace Functions
</A></H3>
<P>
      Normally, each trace action displays a descriptive message,
    such as:
<PRE>
    STATEMENT 371: SENTENCE = 'Ed ran to town',TIME = 810
</PRE>
      Instead, we can instruct SNOBOL4 to call our own programdefined
    function.  This allows us to perform whatever trace
    actions we wish.  We define the trace function in the normal way,
    using DEFINE, and then specify its name as the fourth argument of
    TRACE.  For example, if we want function TRFUN called whenever
    variable COUNT is altered, we would say:
<PRE>
   &amp;TRACE = 10000
   TRACE('COUNT', 'VALUE', , 'TRFUN')
   DEFINE('TRFUN(NAME,ID)')             :(TRFUN_END)
    . . .
</PRE>
      TRFUN will be called with the name of the item being traced,
    'COUNT', as its first argument.  If a third argument was provided
    with TRACE, it too is passed to your trace function, as ID.
    (Here the argument was omitted.)  To use trace functions effectively,
    we must pause to describe a few more SNOBOL4 keywords:
<TABLE CELLPADDING=5>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
       <TD><B>&amp;LASTNO          </B><TD>The statement number of the previous SNOBOL4
                        statement executed.
<P>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
       <TD><B>&amp;STCOUNT         </B><TD>The total number of statements executed.
                        Incremented by one as each statement begins
                        execution.
<P>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
       <TD><B>&amp;ERRTYPE         </B><TD>Error message number of the last execution
                        error.
<P>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
       <TD><B>&amp;ERRLIMIT        </B><TD>Number of nonfatal execution errors allowed
                        before SNOBOL4 will terminate.
</TABLE>
      The first three keywords are continuously updated by SNOBOL4 as
    a program is executed.
<P>
      Now, let's consider debugging a program where variable COUNT is
    inexplicably being set to a negative number.  Continuing with the
    previous example, the function body would look like this:
<PRE>
            &amp;TRACE = 10000
            TRACE('COUNT', 'VALUE', , 'TRFUN')
            DEFINE('TRFUN(NAME,ID)TEMP')         :(TRFUN_END)

    TRFUN   TEMP = &amp;LASTNO
            GE($NAME, 0)                         :S(RETURN)
            OUTPUT = 'COUNT negative in statement ' TEMP  :(END)
    TRFUN_END
</PRE>
      The first statement of the function captures the number of the
    last statement executed -- the statement that triggered the trace.
    We then check COUNT, and return if it is satisfactory.  If it is
    negative, we print an error message and stop the program.
<P>
      When a trace function is invoked, keywords &amp;TRACE and &amp;FTRACE
    are temporarily set to zero.  Their values are restored when the
    trace function returns.  There is no limit to the number of functions
    or items which may be traced.
<P>
      Tracing keyword &amp;STCOUNT will call your trace function before
    every program statement is executed.
<P>
      Program CODE.SNO traces keyword &amp;ERRTYPE to trap nonfatal execution
    errors from your sample statements, and produce an error
    message.  Keyword &amp;ERRLIMIT must be set nonzero to prevent
    SNOBOL4 from terminating when an error occurs.
<H3><A NAME="8.3">
                         8.3 PROGRAM EFFICIENCY
</A></H3>
<P>
      To a greater extent than other languages, SNOBOL4 programs are
    sensitive to programming methods.  Often, there are many different
    ways to formulate a pattern match, and some will require many
    more match attempts than others.
<P>
      As you work with SNOBOL4, you will develop an intuitive feel
    for the operation of the pattern matcher, and will write more
    efficient patterns.  I can, however, start you off with some general
    rules:
<OL>
      <LI>Try to use anchored, quickscan, and trim modes when possible.
     If operating unanchored, artificially anchor whenever
         possible by using POS(0) or FENCE as the first subpattern.
<P>
      <LI>Try to use BREAK and SPAN instead of ARB.
<P>
      <LI>Use ANY instead of an explicit list of one-character strings
         and the alternation operator.
<P>
      <LI>LEN, TAB and RTAB are faster than POS and RPOS.  The former
         &quot;step over&quot; subject characters in one operation; the latter
         continually fail until the subject cursor is positioned correctly.
     But be careful of misusing them with replacement
         and replacing more than you expected.
<P>
      <LI>Use conditional assignment instead of immediate assignment
         in pattern matching.
<P>
      <LI>Use IDENT and DIFFER to compare strings for equality,
         instead of pattern matching.  Since each unique string is
         stored only once in SNOBOL4, these functions merely compare
         one-word pointers, regardless of string length.  By contrast,
         pattern matching and functions such as LGT must
         perform character by character comparisons.
<P>
      <LI>Avoid ARBNO and recursion if possible.
<P>
      <LI>Pattern construction is time-consuming.  Preconstruct patterns
        and store them in variables whenever possible.
<P>
      <LI>Keep strings modest in length.  Although SNOBOL4 allows
         strings to be thousands of characters long, operating upon
         them is very time-consuming.  They use large amounts of
         memory, and force SNOBOL4 to frequently rearrange storage.
<P>
      <LI>Use functions to modularize a program and make it easier to
         understand and maintain.
<P>
      <LI>Avoid algorithms that make a linear search of an array or
         list.  The algorithms can usually be rewritten using tables
         and indirect references for associative programming.
</OL><P>
      Efficiency should not be measured purely in terms of program
    execution time.  With the relatively low cost of microcomputers,
    the larger picture of time spent designing, coding, and debugging
    a program also must be considered.  A direct approach, emphasizing
    simplicity, robustness, and ease of understanding usually
    outweighs the advantages of tricky algorithms and shortcut techniques.
     (But we admit that tricky pattern matching is fun!)
