<H2>Chapter 7 : ADVANCED TOPICS</H2>
<P>
      The material presented so far allows you to write powerful
    SNOBOL4 programs.  In this chapter, we will examine other interesting
    and useful features of the language.
<H3><A NAME="7.1">
                         7.1 THE ARBNO FUNCTION
</A></H3>
<P>
      This function produces a pattern which will match zero or more
    consecutive occurrences of the pattern specified by its argument.
    As its name implies, ARBNO is useful when an arbitrary number of
    instances of a pattern may occur.  For example, ARBNO(LEN(3))
    matches strings of length 0, 3, 6, 9, ....  There is no restriction
    on the complexity of the pattern argument.
<P>
      Like the ARB pattern, ARBNO is shy, and tries to match the
    shortest possible string.  Initially, it simply matches the null
    string.  If a subsequent pattern component fails to match,
    SNOBOL4 backs up, and asks ARBNO to try again.  Each time ARBNO
    is retried, it supplies another instance of its argument pattern.
    In other words, ARBNO(PAT) behaves like
<PRE>
    ( '' |  PAT | PAT PAT | PAT PAT PAT | ... )
</PRE>
      Also like ARB, ARBNO is usually used with adjacent patterns to
    &quot;draw it out.&quot;  Let's consider a simple example.  We want to
    write a pattern to test for a list.  We'll define a list as being
    one or more numbers separated by comma, and enclosed by parentheses.
     Use CODE.SNO to try this definition:
<PRE>
    ?       ITEM = SPAN('0123456789')
    ?       LIST = POS(0) '(' ITEM  ARBNO(',' ITEM) ')' RPOS(0)
    ?       '(12,345,6)' LIST
    Success
    ?       '(12,,34)' LIST
    Failure
</PRE>
      ARBNO is retried and extended until its subsequent, ')', finally
    matches.  POS(0) and RPOS(0) force the pattern to be applied
    to the entire subject string.
<P>
      Alternation may be used within ARBNO's argument.  This pattern
    matches any number of pairs of certain letters:
<PRE>
    ?       PAIRS = POS(0) ARBNO('AA' | 'BB' | 'CC') RPOS(0)
    ?       'CCBBAAAACC' PAIRS
    Success
    ?       'AABBB' PAIRS
    Failure
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="7.2">
                         7.2 RECURSIVE PATTERNS
</A></H3>
<P>
      This is the pattern analogue of a recursive function -- a pattern
    is defined in terms of itself.  The unevaluated expression
    operator makes the definition possible.
<P>
      Suppose we wanted to expand the previous definition of a list
    to say that a list item may be a span of digits, or another list.
    The definition proceeds as before, except that the unevaluated
    expression operator is used in the first statement; the concept
    of a list has not yet been defined:
<PRE>
    ?       ITEM = SPAN('0123456789') | *LIST
    ?       LIST = '(' ITEM  ARBNO(',' ITEM) ')'
    ?       TEST = POS(0) LIST RPOS(0)
    ?       '(12,(3,45,(6)),78)' TEST
    Success
    ?       '(12,(34)' TEST
    Failure
</PRE>
      Recursion occurs because LIST is defined in terms of ITEM,
    which is defined in terms of LIST, and so on.  Note that functions
    POS(0) and RPOS(0) were &quot;moved out one level,&quot; to TEST, because
    LIST must now match substrings within the subject.
<P>
      In our previous discussion of recursive functions, we said they
    work because successive calls present the function with progressively
    simpler problems, until the problem can be solved without
    further recursion.  Similarly, patterns ITEM and LIST are applied
    to successively smaller substrings, until ITEM can use its SPAN()
    alternative instead of invoking LIST again.
<P>
      In general, you will need an alternative somewhere in the recursive
    loop to allow the pattern matcher &quot;a way out.&quot;  Also, you
    should place recursive objects last in a series of alternatives,
    so that the simpler, nonrecursive patterns are attempted first
    and &quot;recursive plunges&quot; can be avoided.
<P>
      SNOBOL4 saves information on a &quot;pattern stack&quot; during the pattern
    match process.  Heavily recursive patterns and long subject
    strings can sometimes result in stack overflow.  If this occurs,
    you should break the problem apart into several smaller pattern
    matches.
<P>
      As recursive patterns use the unevaluated expression operator,
    it is sometimes necessary to disable SNOBOL4's heuristics by
    setting &amp;FULLSCAN = 1.
<H3><A NAME="7.3">
                       7.3 QUICKSCAN AND FULLSCAN
</A></H3>
<P>
      Pattern matching can be very time-consuming because of the number
    of possibilities which must be attempted.  In the normal
    &quot;quickscan&quot; mode, SNOBOL4 stops searching for a match when it
<P>
    thinks further efforts would be futile.  The heuristics are complex,
    but can be summarized as follows: pattern matching fails
    when there are insufficient subject characters to satisfy the remaining
    pattern components.
<P>
      The cursor operator can be used to demonstrate at what point
    SNOBOL4 gives up.  For example, in the pattern match
<PRE>
    ?       'ABCD' @OUTPUT 'X' LEN(3)
    0
    Failure
</PRE>
      SNOBOL4 does not attempt to match 'X' against 'B' because fewer
    than 3 subject characters remain after it, and LEN(3) could never
    succeed.
<P>
      A second type of heuristic is the &quot;one character assumption&quot;
    for unevaluated expressions.  SNOBOL4 assumes that unevaluated
    expressions will match at least one character.  This heuristic
    was originally provided to break recursive loops, but can cause
    programming problems when an unevaluated expression must match
    the null string.  Consider a pattern which succeeds if 'B' is at
    least 4 character positions beyond an 'A' in the subject:
<PRE>
    ?       P = 'A' ARB $ X 'B' *GE(SIZE(X), 4)
    ?       'A12345BC' P
    Success
    ?       'A12345B' P
    Failure
</PRE>
      The characters between 'A' and 'B' are matched by ARB, and immediately
    assigned to X.  The size of X is then compared to 4 by
    the GE function, which succeeds and returns the null string.
    This null string result should not interfere with the pattern
    match, but we find the pattern misbehaves when 'B' is the last
    character of the subject.  The unevaluated expression operator
    made SNOBOL4 assume a one character length for the GE function,
    and matching 'B' against the last subject character was never attempted.
<P>
               For most pattern matching, heuristics are invisible.  However,
    there are circumstances when we would like SNOBOL4 to be exhaustive
    in its match attempts.  We can disable heuristics and enter
    &quot;fullscan&quot; mode by setting keyword &amp;FULLSCAN nonzero:
<PRE>
    ?       &amp;FULLSCAN = 1
    ?       'A12345B' P
    Success
    ?       'ABCD' @OUTPUT 'X' LEN(3)
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    Failure
</PRE>
      The quickscan mode can be reinstated by setting &amp;FULLSCAN = 0.
<H3><A NAME="7.4">
                      7.4 OTHER PRIMITIVE PATTERNS
</A></H3>
<P>
      We can accomplish quite a lot with just the primitive patterns
    ARB and REM.  However, there are five additional patterns which
    you should be aware of:
<UL>
    <LI><B>ABORT</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;End pattern match
<P>
      The ABORT pattern causes immediate failure of the entire pattern
    match, without seeking other alternatives.  Usually a match
    succeeds when we find a subject sequence which satisfies the pattern.
     The ABORT pattern does the opposite: if we find a certain
    pattern, we will abort the match and fail immediately.  For example,
    suppose we are looking for an 'A' or 'B', but want to fail
    if '1' is encountered first:
<PRE>
    ?       '--AB-1-' (ANY('AB') | '1' ABORT)
    Success
    ?       '--1B-A-' (ANY('AB') | '1' ABORT)
    Failure
</PRE>
      The last example may be confusing because the ANY function appears
    as the first alternative, fostering the illusion that it
    will find the 'B' in the subject before the other pattern alternative
    is tried.  However, that is not the order of pattern
    matching; ALL pattern alternatives are tried at cursor position
    zero in the subject.  If none succeed, the cursor is advanced by
    one, and all alternatives are tried again.  When the cursor is in
    front of subject character '1', ANY still does not match, but the
    second alternative now does.  As the '1's match, ABORT is
    reached, causing failure.
<P>
    <LI><B>BAL</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Match balanced string
<P>
      The BAL pattern matches the shortest nonnull string in which
    parentheses are balanced.  (A string without parentheses is also
    considered to be balanced.)  These strings are balanced:
<PRE>
    (X)      Y      (A!(C:D))      (AB)+(CD)      9395
</PRE>
      These are not:
<PRE>
    )A+B     (A*(B+)      (X))
</PRE>
      BAL is concerned only with left and right parentheses.  The
    matching string does not have to be a well-formed expression in
    the algebraic sense; in fact, it needn't be an algebraic expression
    at all.  Like ARB, BAL is most useful when constrained on
    both sides by other pattern components.
<P>
    <LI><B>FAIL</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seek other alternatives
<P>
      The FAIL pattern signals failure of this portion of the pattern
    match, causing the pattern matcher to backtrack and seek other
    alternatives.  FAIL will also suppress a successful match, which
    can be very useful when the match is being performed for its side
    effects, such as immediate assignment.  For example, in unanchored
    mode, this statement will display the subject characters,
    one per line:
<PRE>
    SUBJECT LEN(1) $ OUTPUT FAIL
</PRE>
      LEN(1) matches the first subject character, and immediately assigns
    it to OUTPUT.  FAIL tells the pattern matcher to try again,
    and since there are no other alternatives, the entire match is
    retried at the next subject character.  Forced failure and retries
    continue until the subject is exhausted.
<P>
    <LI><B>FENCE</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Prevent match retries
<P>
      Pattern FENCE matches the null string and has no effect when
    the pattern matcher is moving left to right in a pattern.  However,
    if the pattern matcher is backing up to try other alternatives,
    and encounters FENCE, the match fails.
<P>
      FENCE can be used to &quot;lock in&quot; an earlier success.  Suppose we
    want to succeed if the first 'A' or 'B' in the subject is followed
    by a plus sign.  In the following example, the 'A's match,
    we go through the FENCE, and find '+' does not match the next
    subject character, 'B'.  SNOBOL4 tries to backtrack, but is
    stopped by the FENCE and fails:
<PRE>
    ?       '1AB+' ANY('AB') FENCE '+'
    Failure
</PRE>
      If FENCE were omitted, backtracking would match ANY to 'B', and
    then proceed forward again to match '+'.
<P>
      If FENCE appears as the first component of a pattern, SNOBOL4
    cannot back up through it to try another subject starting position.
     This results in an anchored pattern, even if the &amp;ANCHOR
    keyword specifies unanchored mode:
<PRE>
    ?       'ABC' FENCE 'B'
    Failure
</PRE>
    <LI><B>SUCCEED</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Match always
<P>
      This pattern matches the null string and always succeeds.  If
    the scanner is backtracking when it encounters SUCCEED, it reverses
    and starts forward again.  Placing a pattern between
    SUCCEED and FAIL causes the pattern matcher to oscillate.

                           7.5 OTHER FUNCTIONS
</A></H3>
<P>
      I'd like to briefly point out a few more built-in functions.
    See <A HREF="../manual/ch8.htm">Chapter 8 of the Reference Manual</A> for a complete description of their use.
<TABLE CELLPADDING=5>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD><B>APPLY</B>            <TD>Allows an indirect call to a function through
                     a variable.

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD><B>CONVERT</B>          <TD>Provides explicit conversion from one data

                     possible.

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD><B>ENDFILE</B>          <TD>Closes a file and detaches all variables

    <TD><B>ITEM</B>             <TD>Allows an indirect reference to an array or

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD><B>LPAD</B> &amp; <B>RPAD</B>      <TD>These are padding functions, which will pad a
                     string on its left or right side with blanks
                     or a given character.  Padding is provided to
                     a specified width, and is useful when producing
                     columnar output.
</TABLE>

<H3><A NAME="7.6">
                        7.6 OTHER UNARY OPERATORS
</A></H3>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=5>
    <TR><TD><B>Operation:</B>     <TD>Negation
    <TR><TD><B>Symbol:</B>        <TD>~ (tilde)
</TABLE>
<UL>
      The negation operator, or tilde (~), inverts the success or
    failure result of its operand.  If the expression X succeeds,
    then ~X fails.  Conversely, if X fails, ~X succeeds and returns
    the null string.
</UL><P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=5>
    <TR><TD><B>Operation:</B>     <TD>Interrogation
    <TR><TD><B>Symbol</B>         <TD>? (question mark)
</TABLE>
<UL>
      Unary question mark is called the interrogation operator, although
    &quot;value annihilation&quot; might be more descriptive.  If X is
    an expression which fails, ?X also fails.  However, if X succeeds,
    ?X also succeeds, and returns the null string.  In other
    words, any value component of X is replaced by the null string.
</UL><P>

<H3><A NAME="7.7">
                        7.7 RUN-TIME COMPILATION
</A></H3>
<P>
      The two functions described below are among the most esoteric
    features, not just of SNOBOL4, but of all programming languages
    in existence.  While your program is executing, the entire
    SNOBOL4 compiler is just a function call away.
<P>
      A SNOBOL4 program is nothing more than a string of characters.
    The functions EVAL and CODE let you supply the compiler with
    character strings from within the program itself.
<H3><A NAME="7.7.1">
    7.7.1 The EVAL Function
</A></H3>
<P>
      This function is used to evaluate an expression.  Its argument
    may take a number of forms:
<OL>
      <LI>If the argument is an integer, or a number in string form,
         the number is returned as the function result:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = EVAL(19)
    19
</PRE>
<P>
      <LI>If the argument is an unevaluated expression, it is evaluated
    using current values for any variables it might contain.
     EVAL returns the expression's value as its result:
<PRE>
    ?       E = *('N SQUARED IS ' N ** 2)
    ?       N = 15
    ?       OUTPUT = EVAL(E)
    N SQUARED IS 225
</PRE>
         This is similar to our earlier use of unevaluated expressions
    with patterns.  In this case, however, the unevaluated
         expression operator (*) must be applied to the entire expression
    to create an object with the EXPRESSION data type.
<P>
      <LI>If the argument is a string (other than a simple number),
         EVAL tries to compile it as a SNOBOL4 expression.  Only an
         expression is permitted -- not an entire SNOBOL4 statement:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = EVAL('3 * N + 2')
    47
</PRE>
         If the string compiles without error, EVAL then evaluates
         the expression and returns the result.
</OL><P>
      It is this last use of EVAL -- to compile a string -- which is
    the most interesting.  Here is a trivial program which behaves
    like a simple desk calculator.
<PRE>
    LOOP    OUTPUT = EVAL(INPUT)                 :S(LOOP)
    END
</PRE>
      You can easily try it by placing a semicolon after the GOTO to
    protect it from CODE.SNO's own machinations:
<PRE>
    ?LOOP   OUTPUT = EVAL(INPUT)                 :S(LOOP);
    4 * (5 - 2) / 2
    6
    N + 1
    16
    ^Z
</PRE>
      The program reads a line of input, compiles and evaluates it,
    and displays the result.  Each expression you enter must be wellformed
    according to SNOBOL4's syntax rules.  In particular, this
    means there must be blanks around the binary operators.
<P>
      The BNF program included with Vanilla SNOBOL4 demonstrates that
    EVAL's power is useful even if the input data does not conform to
    SNOBOL4 syntax.  It reads a definition of a grammar from a file,
    and converts it to SNOBOL4 patterns.
<P>
      EVAL fails if evaluation of the argument fails, or if the argument
    contains a syntax error.  The SNOBOL4 keyword &amp;ERRTEXT will
    contain a string describing the error.
<P>
      The expressions used with EVAL may return any SNOBOL4 data
    type, not just numbers.  For instance, the expression might construct
    a new pattern, and return it as the result:
<PRE>
    ITEM = EVAL('SPAN(&quot;0123456789&quot;) | *LIST')
</PRE>
      Note that EVAL can only call the compiler with a string argument.
     If we used a pattern as the argument, we would produce an
    execution error:
<PRE>
    ITEM = EVAL(SPAN(&quot;0123456789&quot;) | *LIST)  (incorrect)
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="7.7.2">
    7.7.2 The CODE Function
</A></H3>
<P>
      CODE accepts a string argument containing one or more statements
    to be compiled.  Multiple statements are separated by
    semicolons (;).  Statements may be labeled, and can include all
    the usual components -- subject, pattern, replacement, and GOTO.
    However, comment and continuation statements are not permitted.
<P>
      The CODE function compiles the statements, and returns a pointer
    to the resulting object code.  It fails if any statement
    contains an error, and places an error message in &amp;ERRTEXT.
<P>
      There are two ways to execute the new object code.
<OL>
      <LI>Transfer to a label which is defined in the new code:
<PRE>
    *  Compile a sample piece of code:
            S = 'L OUTPUT = N; N = LT(N,10) N + 1  :S(L)F(DONE)'
            CODE(S)
    *  Transfer to a label in it:
                                                   :(L)
    *  Come here when the new code transfers back.
    DONE     . . .
</PRE>
         Notice how we placed a GOTO from the new code back to label
         DONE in the main program.  If we had not done this, SNOBOL4
         would terminate when execution &quot;fell out of the bottom&quot; of
         the new code block.
<P>
      <LI>The pointer returned by the CODE function can be used in a
         &quot;direct GOTO&quot; to transfer to the first statement in the code
         block.  A direct GOTO is performed by enclosing the pointer
         in angular brackets in the GOTO field:
<PRE>
    *  Compile a sample piece of code:
            S = 'L OUTPUT = N; N = LT(N,10) N + 1  :S(L)F(DONE)'
            C = CODE(S)
    *  Transfer to the first statement in the block:
                                                   :&lt;C&gt;
    DONE     . . .
</PRE>
</OL><P>
      Labels contained in the new program fragment override any
    labels of the same name in your main program.  This provides the
    ability to write self-modifying SNOBOL4 programs, and makes the
    division between &quot;code&quot; and &quot;data&quot; far less distinct than in
    other high-level languages.
