<H2>Chapter 6 : PROGRAM-DEFINED OBJECTS</H2>
<P>
      SNOBOL4 is a very large and rich language, providing a diverse
    assortment of built-in features.  It is also an extensible language;
    it allows you to define new data types, functions, and
    operators.  You can, by creating your own entities, obtain
    another level of conciseness and power of expression.
<P>
      We will begin with program-defined functions because they allow
    a program to be partitioned into smaller, more manageable segments.
     As functions tend to be just a few lines long, transfers
    of control within them are usually obvious and manageable.  If
    your main program has complex, intertwined GOTOs, consider how
    the use of functions would clarify things.
<P>
      Functions also allow us to postpone the complete development of
    an algorithm.  We can design the overall program structure, using
    function names for components which will be developed later.
    Furthermore, if a particular function proves inefficient, it can
    be replaced later with an improved version.
<H3><A NAME="6.1">
                      6.1 PROGRAM-DEFINED FUNCTIONS
</A></H3>
<P>
      The concept of a function should be clear from all the examples
    of SNOBOL4's built-in functions.  A function accepts some number
    of arguments, performs a computation based on their values, and
    returns a result and a success signal.  A function can also signal
    failure, and not return any value.
<H3><A NAME="6.1.1">
    6.1.1 Function Definition
</A></H3>
<P>
      We can define a new function by specifying its name and arguments.
     The definition will be composed of &quot;dummy arguments&quot; -- 
    place holders that show how the arguments are to be used in the
    function.  Later, when the function is called, the actual arguments
    will replace the dummy arguments in the computation.
<P>
      We define a new function in SNOBOL4 by using the built-in function
    DEFINE.  We call it with a &quot;prototype string&quot; containing the
    new function's name and arguments.  DEFINE makes the new function's
    name known to SNOBOL4, so it can be used subsequently.
<P>
      Suppose we want to create a new function called SHIFT, which
    would circularly rotate a string through a specified number of
    character positions.  We'll define all rotations as being to the
    left -- characters removed from the front of the string are placed
    back on the end.  For example, SHIFT('ENGRAVING',3) would return
    the string 'RAVINGENG'.
<P>
      We will begin by defining the function name and its dummy arguments,
    S and N.  Any names of your choosing can by used for dummy
    arguments.  In a program, it would look like this:
<PRE>
    DEFINE('SHIFT(S,N)')
</PRE>
      It is important to realize that the DEFINE function must be
    executed for the definition to occur.  Most other programming
    languages process function definitions when a program is compiled.
     SNOBOL4's system is more flexible; the prototype string
    can itself be the result of other run-time computations.  In an
    extreme case, data input to a program could determine the names
    and kinds of functions to be defined.
<H3><A NAME="6.1.2">
    6.1.2 The Function Body
</A></H3>
<P>
      Having declared the function name and dummy arguments, we need
    to provide the statements which will implement the function.  A
    very simple convention applies:
<P>
         When the function is used, SNOBOL4 transfers control to
         a statement label with the same name as the function.
<P>
      In this case, the first statement of the function would be
    labeled SHIFT.  There is no limit to the number of statements
    comprising the function body.
<H3><A NAME="6.1.3">
    6.1.3 Returning Function Results
</A></H3>
<P>
      First, a function may return a value by assigning it to a variable
    with the same name as the function.  If no assignment
    occurs, the result is the null string.
<P>
      Second, the function must tell SNOBOL4 that it is finished, and
    that control should return back to the caller.  It does this by
    transferring to the special label RETURN.
<P>
      The label RETURN should not appear anywhere in your program.
    It is a special name, reserved by SNOBOL4 for just this purpose.
<P>
      With this information, we can now write our SHIFT function.  We
    will remove the first N characters from the beginning of the argument
    string, and place them on the end.  The function body
    looks like this:
<PRE>
    SHIFT   S LEN(N) . FRONT REM . REST
            SHIFT = REST FRONT                   :(RETURN)
</PRE>
      Each time SHIFT is called, the particular arguments used are
    placed in S and N.  The first statement splits S into two parts,
    assigning them to variables FRONT and REST.  The second statement
    reassembles them in the shifted order, and assigns them to vari-
<P>
    able SHIFT, to be returned as the function result.  The GOTO then
    transfers to label RETURN to return back to the caller.
<H3><A NAME="6.1.4">
    6.1.4 Function Failure
</A></H3>
<P>
      What happens if we try the function call SHIFT('PEAR',7)?  As
    the function is defined above, the pattern match would fail,
    since LEN(7) is longer than the subject string.  The assignment
    to FRONT and REST would not take place, and the function would
    return an erroneous result.
<P>
      Now we could extend the definition of SHIFT to cycle the
    argument string multiple times.  In general, though, we want to
    develop a convenient method that allows a function to signal an
    exceptional condition back to the caller.  Function failure
    allows us to do just that.  Another convention is provided:
<P>
         Transferring to the special label FRETURN returns from
         a function signaling failure to the caller.  No value
         is returned as the function result.
<P>
      We can now rework the function body to signal failure when N is
    too large.  In this case, the pattern match fails, and we detect
    the failure in the GOTO field:
<PRE>
    SHIFT   S LEN(N) . FRONT REM . REST          :F(FRETURN)
            SHIFT = REST FRONT                   :(RETURN)
</PRE>
      In general, the transfer to FRETURN does not need to be the
    result of the failure of a particular statement.  Any success or
    failure could be tested to produce a transfer to FRETURN.  For
    example, if we decided to explicitly test the length of S, the
    function could begin with:
<PRE>
    SHIFT   GT(N, SIZE(S))                       :S(FRETURN)
            . . .
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="6.1.5">
    6.1.5 Local Variables
</A></H3>
<P>
      FRONT and REST were used in this function as temporary variables
    to rearrange the argument string.  If they had appeared
    elsewhere in your program, their old values would be destroyed.
    Such inadvertent conflicts become harder to avoid as your function
    library grows.  The prototype string used with DEFINE can
    specify &quot;local variables&quot; to be protected when the function is
    called.  For our SHIFT function, the call would look like this:
<PRE>
    DEFINE('SHIFT(S,N)FRONT,REST')
</PRE>
      The local variables appear after the argument list.  When SHIFT
    is called, any existing values for FRONT and REST will be saved
    on a pushdown stack.  FRONT and REST are set to the null string,
<P>
    and control is transferred to the first statement of the function
    body.  When the function returns, FRONT and REST are restored to
    their previous values.
<P>
      Since the same potential problem exists for dummy arguments S
    and N, SNOBOL4 automatically saves their values before assigning
    the actual arguments to them.  And just like local variables,
    when the function returns, the dummy arguments are restored to
    their original values.
<H3><A NAME="6.1.6">
    6.1.6 Using Functions
</A></H3>
<P>
      Once a function has been defined, it may be used in exactly the
    same manner as a built-in function.  It may appear in a statement
    anywhere its value is needed -- in the subject, pattern, or
    replacement fields.  If used with the indirect reference operation,
    functions may even be used in the GOTO field.  Of course, a
    function may be used as the argument of another function.
<P>
      The value returned by a function is not restricted to strings.
    Any SNOBOL4 data type, including patterns, may be returned.  Earlier,
    in the <A HREF="ch4.htm">pattern match chapter</A>, we showed how simple patterns
    could be tailored to our needs by using them in more complicated
    clauses.  The specific example was a variation of the BREAK pattern
    which would not match the null string.  Let's use a programdefined
    function to create a new function, BREAK1, with this
    property.  The definition statement might look like this:
<PRE>
    DEFINE('BREAK1(S)')
</PRE>
    and the function body, like this:
<PRE>
    BREAK1  BREAK1 = NOTANY(S) BREAK(S)          :(RETURN)
</PRE>
      This function can now be used directly in a pattern match.  For
    example, BREAK1('abc') constructs a pattern which matches a nonnull
    string, up to the occurrence of the letters 'a', 'b', or
    'c'.  Of course, the pattern returned by a function can be as
    complex as desired, giving us an elegant method to define our own
    pattern matching primitives.
<H3><A NAME="6.1.7">
    6.1.7 Organizing Functions
</A></H3>
<P>
      SNOBOL4 does not know or care which statements belong to a
    particular function.  There is no explicit END statement for
    individual functions.  To keep programs readable, we'll have to
    impose some discipline of our own.  Also, having to execute the
    DEFINE function is a mixed blessing.  It offers tremendous flexibility,
    but requires us to place all our DEFINE's at the beginning
    of a program.  Here is the system proposed by Gimpel, which
    I like to use to manage functions and their definitions:
<P>
      We keep the function definition, any one-time initialization,
    and the function body together as a unit.  A GOTO transfers control
    around the function body after the definition and initialization
    statements are executed.  Also present are comments describing
    its use and any exceptional conditions.  Rewriting the
    SHIFT function in this form, and taking this opportunity to avoid
    rebuilding the pattern each time the function is called, it looks
    like this:
<PRE>
    * SHIFT(S,N)  -  Shift string S left N character positions.
    *  As characters are removed from the left side of the
    *  string, they are placed on the end.
    *
    *  The function fails if N is larger than the size of S.

            DEFINE('SHIFT(S,N)FRONT,REST')
            SHIFT_PAT = LEN(*N) . FRONT REM . REST :(SHIFT_END)

    SHIFT   S SHIFT_PAT                          :F(FRETURN)
            SHIFT = REST FRONT                   :(RETURN)
    SHIFT_END
</PRE>
      Now this group of lines can be incorporated as a unit into the
    beginning of any program that wants to use it.  When execution
    begins, the first statement defines the SHIFT function.  Next we
    define a pattern, called SHIFT_PAT, for use when the function is
    called.  The pattern definition is only executed once, so we use
    the unevaluated expression operator (*N) to obtain the current
    value of N on each function call.  After defining the pattern, we
    &quot;jump around&quot; the function body, to label SHIFT_END.  (Remember,
    we are defining the function now, not executing it; falling into
    the function body would be an error.)  The function is now defined,
    and ready to be used.
<P>
      In general, functions should be prepared in this form:
<PRE>
    * Fname  - Description of use

            DEFINE('Fname(arg1,...,argn)local1,...,localn')
             . . .
    *       Any one-time initialization for Fname
             . . .                               :(Fname_END)

    Fname   Function body
             . . .
    Fname_END
</PRE>
      If you place your functions in individual disk files, they can
    be included in new programs as necessary.  By preparing functions
    in this form, they will all be defined and initialized when execution
    begins.
<P>
      When discussing pattern matching, we used a pattern to convert
    a character to its ASCII decimal value.  In BASIC, two functions
    are provided for similar operations: ASC and CHR$.  We can create
    SNOBOL4 equivalents like this:
<PRE>
    * ASC(S) - Return the ASCII code for the first character of
    *          string S.
    *
    *       The value returned is an integer between 0 and 255.
    *       The function fails if S is null.

            DEFINE('ASC(S)C')
            ASC_ONE = LEN(1) . C
            ASC_PAT = BREAK(*C) @ASC             :(ASC_END)

    ASC     S ASC_ONE                            :F(FRETURN)
            &amp;ALPHABET ASC_PAT                    :(RETURN)
    ASC_END

    * CHR(N) - Converts an integer ASCII code to a one character
    *          string.
    *
    *       The argument N is an integer between 0 and 255.
    *       The function fails if N is greater than 255.

            DEFINE('CHR(N)')
            CHR_PAT = TAB(*N) LEN(1) . CHR       :(CHR_END)

    CHR     &amp;ALPHABET CHR_PAT              :S(RETURN) F(FRETURN)
    CHR_END
</PRE>
      Note that both functions were written to work correctly regardless
    of the anchoring mode in use by the calling program.
<P>
      (The CHR function is shown here as an example only.  Vanilla
    SNOBOL4 provides a built-in function, CHAR(N), for this purpose.
    See <A HREF="../manual/ch8.htm">Chapter 8 of the Reference Manual</A>, &quot;Built-in Functions.&quot;)
<H3><A NAME="6.1.8">
    6.1.8 Call by Value and Call by Name
</A></H3>
<P>
      Function calls in SNOBOL4 transmit the &quot;value&quot; of the argument
    to the function.  Variables used in the function call cannot be
    harmed by the function.  This type of function usage is referred
    to as &quot;call by value.&quot;  Occasionally, we might want the function
    to access the argument variables themselves.  The name operator
    introduced in the previous chapter provides this ability.  The
    function call still transmits a value, but the value used is the
    &quot;name&quot; of a variable.
<P>
      Consider a function called SWAP, which will exchange the contents
    of two variables.  If we wanted to exchange the contents of
    variables COUNT and OLDCOUNT, we would say SWAP(.COUNT,
    .OLDCOUNT).  The function looks like this:
<PRE>
    * SWAP(.V1, .V2) - Exchange the contents of two variables.
    *  The variables must be prefixed with the name operator
    *  when the function is called.

            DEFINE('SWAP(X,Y)TEMP')              :(SWAP_END)

    SWAP    TEMP = $X
            $X = $Y
            $Y = TEMP                            :(RETURN)
    SWAP_END
</PRE>
      The name operator allows us to access the argument variables.
    If we had not used it, the function would be called with the
    variables' values, with no indication of where they came from.
    Calls to SWAP are not limited to simple variable arguments.  Anything
    capable of receiving the name operator, such as array and
    table elements, could be used:  SWAP(.A&lt;4,3&gt;, .T&lt;'YOU'&gt;).
<P>
      There are certain situations where call by name occurs implicitly.
     If the argument is an array or table name, or a programdefined
    data type (discussed below), it points to the actual data
    object, which can then be modified by the function.  For example,
    if FILL were a function which loads an array with values read
    from a file, the statements
<PRE>
    A = ARRAY(25)
    FILL(A)
</PRE>
    would cause array A to be altered.
<H3><A NAME="6.1.9">
    6.1.9 Functions and CODE.SNO
</A></H3>
<P>
      The CODE.SNO program was provided to allow interactive experiments
    with SNOBOL4 statements.  If you create functions using the
    preceding format, they also can be tested using CODE.SNO.
<P>
      Use your text editor to create a disk file containing the SHIFT
    function.  (Be certain to include the GOTO that transfers around
    the function body.)  Call the file SHIFT.SNO.  Now, start the
    CODE.SNO program, and type the following:
<PRE>
    ?       SLOAD('SHIFT.SNO')
    Success
    ?       OUTPUT = SHIFT('COTTON',4)
    ONCOTT
    ?       OUTPUT = SHIFT('OAK',4)
    Failure
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="6.1.1">
    6.1.10 Recursive Functions
</A></H3>
<P>
      The statements that comprise a function are free to call any
    functions they choose, including the function they are defining.
    Of course, for this to make sense, they must call themselves with
    a simplified version of the original problem, or an endless loop
    would result.  Eventually, the function calls itself with an argument
    so simple that it can return an answer without any further
    recursive calls.  It's like winding a clock spring up.  The
    central, non-recursive answer to the innermost call provides an
    answer to the next turn out, with the recursive calls unwinding
    until the original problem can be solved.
<P>
      There is no explicit declaration for recursion; any function
    can be used recursively if it is designed properly.  However, all
    local variables should be declared in the DEFINE function so they
    will be saved and restored during recursive calls.
<P>
      Sometimes, recursion can produce dramatically smaller programs.
    &quot;Algorithms in SNOBOL4&quot; provides a example with the recursive
    function, ROMAN.  It convert's an integer in the range 0 to 3999
    to its Roman numeral equivalent.  Two premises are required:
<OL>
      <LI>We know the Roman numerals for the numbers 0 to 9 (null, I,
         II, ..., IX), and can perform this conversion with a simple
         pattern match.
<P>
      <LI>We can use the REPLACE function to &quot;multiply&quot; a number in
         Roman form by 10 by replacing I by X, V by L, X by C, etc.
</OL><P>
      The function uses these two rules to produce a recursive solution
    for some integer N.  The algorithm looks like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
         The rightmost digit is removed from the argument and
         converted by premise 1.  Removing the digit effectively
         divides the argument by 10, simplifying the problem.
<P>
         The reduced argument is then converted by calling ROMAN
         recursively and &quot;multiplying&quot; the result by 10 according
    to premise 2.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
         The previously converted unit's digit is appended to
         the result.
<P>
    Here's the function (note that a &quot;plus sign&quot; in column one allows
    a statement to be continued over several lines):
<PRE>
    * ROMAN(N) - Convert integer N to Roman numeral form.
    *
    *  N must be positive and less than 4000.
    *
    *  An asterisk appears in the result if N &gt;= 4000.
    *
    *  The function fails if N is not an integer.

            DEFINE('ROMAN(N)UNITS')              :(ROMAN_END)

    *  Get rightmost digit to UNITS and remove it from N.
    *  Return null result if argument is null.
    ROMAN   N RPOS(1) LEN(1) . UNITS =           :F(RETURN)

    *  Search for digit, replace with its Roman form.
    *  Return failing if not a digit.
            '0,1I,2II,3III,4IV,5V,6VI,7VII,8VIII,9IX,'  UNITS
    +         BREAK(',') . UNITS                 :F(FRETURN)

    *  Convert rest of N and multiply by 10.  Propagate a
    *  failure return from recursive call back to caller.
            ROMAN = REPLACE(ROMAN(N), 'IVXLCDM', 'XLCDM**')
    +               UNITS            :S(RETURN) F(FRETURN)
    ROMAN_END
</PRE>
      The first call to ROMAN may have an integer argument.  The
    statement labeled ROMAN causes N to be converted to a string, and
    subsequent recursive calls use a string argument.  The recursive
    calls cease when reducing N finally produces a null string
    argument -- the match at statement ROMAN fails, and the function
    returns immediately with a null result.
<H3><A NAME="6.2">
                     6.2 PROGRAM-DEFINED DATA TYPES
</A></H3>
<P>
      With the exception of arrays and tables, a variable may have
    only one item of data in it at a time.  In many applications, it
    is convenient if several data items can be associated with a
    variable.  For example, if we wanted to work with complex numbers,
    a variable should contain two numbers -- the real and imaginary
    parts.  In an inventory system, an individual product might
    require values such as name, price, quantity, and manufacturer.
<P>
      Program-defined data types enlarge SNOBOL4's repertoire to
    include new objects such as COMPLEX or PRODUCT.  SNOBOL4 only
    provides a system for managing these new types; defining a data
    type does not magically invest SNOBOL4 with a knowledge of complex
    arithmetic or inventory accounting.  It is still up to you
    to provide the computational support for each new type.
<H3><A NAME="6.2.1">
    6.2.1 Data Type Definition
</A></H3>
<P>
      A program-defined data type will consist of a number of fields,
<P>
    each containing an individual data element.  We begin by selecting
    names for the data type and fields.  An inventory system
    might use the data type name PRODUCT, and field names NAME,
    PRICE, QUANTITY, and MFG.
<P>
      A data type is defined by providing a prototype string to the
    built-in DATA function.  The prototype assumes a form similar to
    a function call, with the data type taking the place of the function
    name, and the field names replacing the arguments.  The form
    of the prototype string is:
<PRE>
    'TYPENAME(FIELD1,FIELD2,...,FIELDn)'
</PRE>
      Blanks are not permitted within a prototype.  Try creating a
    new data type using the CODE.SNO program:
<PRE>
    ?       DATA('PRODUCT(NAME,PRICE,QUANTITY,MFG)')
    Success
</PRE>
      The DATA function tells SNOBOL4 to define an object creation
    function with the new data type's name:
<PRE>
    PRODUCT(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4)
</PRE>
      This new function can be called whenever we wish to create a
    new object with the PRODUCT data type.  Its arguments are the
    initial values to be given to the four fields which comprise a
    PRODUCT.  The function returns a pointer to the new object, which
    can be stored in a variable, array, or table.  Try creating two
    new objects as follows:
<PRE>
    ?      ITEM1 = PRODUCT('CAPERS', 2, 48, 'BRINE BROTHERS')
    ?      ITEM2 = PRODUCT('PICKLES', 1, 72, 'PETER PIPER INC.')
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="6.2.2">
    6.2.2 Data Type Use
</A></H3>
<P>
      The defining call to the DATA function also created several
    field reference functions.  In this case, their names would be:
<PRE>
    NAME(arg)    PRICE(arg)    QUANTITY(arg)    MFG(arg)
</PRE>
      The argument used with each function is an object created by
    the PRODUCT function.  Try accessing ITEM1's fields:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = MFG(ITEM1)
    BRINE BROTHERS
    ?       OUTPUT = PRICE(ITEM1) * QUANTITY(ITEM1)
    96
</PRE>
      We can alter the value of a field after an object is created.
    Field reference functions can also be used as the object of an
    assignment, so:
<PRE>
    ?       QUANTITY(ITEM2) = QUANTITY(ITEM2) - 12
</PRE>
    changes the QUANTITY field of ITEM2 from 72 to 60.
<H3><A NAME="6.2.3">
    6.2.3 Copying Data Items
</A></H3>
<P>
      It is important to recognize that variables like ITEM1 and
    ITEM2 contain &quot;pointers&quot; to the data.  Assigning ITEM1 to another
    variable, say LASTITEM, merely copies the pointer; both variables
    still point to the same physical packet of data in memory.
    Altering the QUANTITY field of ITEM1 would alter the QUANTITY
    field of LASTITEM.  This is the same behavior observed earlier
    for array and table names.
<P>
      The built-in COPY function creates a unique copy of an object--
    one which is independent of the original.  Try using it with
    CODE.SNO:
<PRE>
    ?       LASTITEM = COPY(ITEM1)
    ?       QUANTITY(ITEM1) = 24
    ?       OUTPUT = QUANTITY(LASTITEM)
    48
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="6.2.4">
    6.2.4 Creating Structures
</A></H3>
<P>
      Our inventory example used string and integer values as the
    field contents.  In fact, any SNOBOL4 data type may be stored in
    a field, including pointers to other program-defined types.  Complex
    structures, such as queues, stacks, trees, and arbitrary
    graphs may be created.
<P>
      For example, if we wanted to link together all products made by
    the same manufacturer, PRODUCT could be defined with an additional
    field.  We won't go through the exercise with CODE.SNO,
    but will sketch out the changes:
<PRE>
    DATA('PRODUCT(NAME,PRICE,QUANTITY,MFG,MFGLINK')
</PRE>
      As each product is defined, we will determine if we have
    another product from the same manufacturer.  If so, MFGLINK is
    set to point to that other product.  If not, it is set to the
    null string.  A table M provides a convenient way to keep track
    of manufacturers.  Assume variable COMPANY contains the manufacturer's
    name as each product is defined.  Then all of the requisite
    searching and linking can be accomplished in one statement:
<PRE>
    M&lt;COMPANY&gt; = PRODUCT(..., ..., ..., COMPANY, M&lt;COMPANY&gt;)
</PRE>
      If this is the company's first appearance, it is not in the
    table, and the last argument to the PRODUCT function sets MFGLINK
    to the null string.  The assignment statement uses the company as
    the table subscript, and the entry points to the current product.
<P>
    If another product definition uses the same company, MFGLINK will
    point to the previous product, and the table will be updated to
    point to the current product.  In this manner, all products from
    a manufacturer will be threaded together.  Each thread starts
    with a table entry, and goes through each product's MFGLINK
    field, ending with a null string in the last product's MFGLINK.
<P>
      Now if we wanted to display all products supplied by a particular
    manufacturer, we select and follow the appropriate thread:
<PRE>
            X      =  M&lt;COMPANY&gt;
    LOOP    OUTPUT =  DIFFER(X) NAME(X)          :F(DONE)
            X      =  MFGLINK(X)                 :(LOOP)
    DONE
</PRE>

    6.2.5 The DATATYPE Function
</A></H3>
<P>
      The DATATYPE function allows you to learn the type of data in a
    particular variable.  It is useful when the kind of processing to
    be performed depends on the data type.  The formal data type name
    is returned as an upper-case string:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = DATATYPE(54)
    INTEGER
    ?       OUTPUT = DATATYPE(ITEM1)
    PRODUCT
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="6.3">
                      6.3 PROGRAM-DEFINED OPERATORS
</A></H3>
<P>
      If you can define new functions and data types, why not new
    operators too?  Indeed, SNOBOL4 provides this feature, although
    most programs can be written without it.  For the sake of completeness,
    we'll provide a brief discussion.
<H3><A NAME="6.3.1">
    6.3.1 Operators and Functions
</A></H3>
<P>
      Unary or binary operators can be thought of as functions of one
    or two arguments.  For example, A + B can be written in functional
    form as PLUS(A,B), where PLUS is some function which implements
    addition.  Operators can be redefined by specifying a
    function to replace them.  We still write our program in terms of
    the operator's graphic symbol, but SNOBOL4 will use the specified
    function whenever the operator must be performed.
<P>
      The built-in function OPSYN creates synonyms and new definitions
    for operators.  Synonyms permit different names or symbols
    to be used in place of a function or operator.  The general form
    of OPSYN is:
<PRE>
    OPSYN(new name, old name, i)
</PRE>
      The new name is defined as a synonym of the old name.  The
    third argument is 0, 1, or 2 if we are defining functions, unary
    operators, or binary operators respectively.
<H3><A NAME="6.3.2">
    6.3.2 Function Synonyms
</A></H3>
<P>
      We can make the name LENGTH a synonym for the SIZE function:
<PRE>
    ?       OPSYN('LENGTH', 'SIZE', 0)
    ?       OUTPUT = LENGTH('RABBIT')
    6
</PRE>
      The word synonym is not quite an accurate description of OPSYN.
    The name LENGTH becomes associated with the &quot;code&quot; that implements
    the SIZE function, not with the word SIZE per se.  If SIZE
    was subsequently redefined -- perhaps as a program-defined
    function--LENGTH would continue to return the number of
    characters in a string.
<H3><A NAME="6.3.3">
    6.3.3 Operator Synonyms
</A></H3>
<P>
      Take a moment to examine the tables in <A HREF="../manual/ch4.htm">Chapter 4 of the Reference Manual</A>, &quot;Operators,&quot;
    in the reference section.  Note that in each table there are a
    number of operator symbols whose definition is &lt;none&gt;.
<P>
      If you use an undefined binary operator, you'll get an error:
<PRE>
    ?       OUTPUT = 1 # 1
    Execution error #5, Undefined function or operation
</PRE>
      However, we could make this operator synonymous with the DIFFER
    function (which also uses two arguments) and use it instead:
<PRE>
    ?       OPSYN('#', 'DIFFER', 2)
    ?       OUTPUT = 1 # 2
    Failure
</PRE>
      Conversely, we can define a function in place of an operator:
<PRE>
    ?       OPSYN('PLUS', '+', 2)
    ?       OUTPUT = PLUS(4, 5)
    9
</PRE>
      Unary operators can be similarly treated, using 1 as the third
    argument:
<PRE>
    ?       OPSYN('!', 'ANY', 1)
    ?       'ABC321' !'3C' . OUTPUT
    C
</PRE>
      Operators can be created to maintain a stack, or navigate
    around a tree.  The full generality of functions and programdefined
    data types are available to your operators.  Through this
    technique you can make SNOBOL4 speak the language of your
    particular problem.
