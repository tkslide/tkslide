<H2>Chapter 3 : INPUT/OUTPUT AND KEYWORDS</H2>
<H3><A NAME="3.1">
                            3.1 INPUT/OUTPUT
</A></H3>
<P>
      We've already performed simple input and output with variables
    INPUT and OUTPUT.  In this chapter, you'll learn more about
    SNOBOL4's I/O capabilities.
<P>
      SNOBOL4 can communicate with up to 16 different files at once.
    A &quot;file&quot; is either a disk file or a device, such as a printer.
    Every file is identified by a &quot;unit number,&quot; which is an integer
    between 1 and 16.  You chose the numbers when you select the
    files you wish to use.  The particular numbers chosen have no
    special significance; they just distinguish one file from
    another.
<P>
      Actual input or output of data is performed by &quot;associating&quot; a
    variable with a unit number and a direction.  When a statement
    tries to use the variable's value, a line is read from the associated
    file.  When a value is stored in the variable, a line is
    written to the associated file.  INPUT and OUTPUT are variables
    whose association with the keyboard and screen were preset by
    SNOBOL4.  For historical reasons, they use unit numbers 5 and 6
    respectively.
<P>
      Strings are the only data type which can be transferred to and
    from files.  A successful input operation always returns a
    string.  During output, nonstring objects, such as integers, are
    automatically converted to their string form.
<P>
      The functions INPUT and OUTPUT (not to be confused with the
    variables INPUT and OUTPUT) are provided to attach a unit number
    to a variable, and optionally, to a particular file.  Their names
    are distinguished from the variables of the same names by appearing
    as functions, that is, with parentheses and an argument list.
<H3><A NAME="3.1.1">
    3.1.1 Associating File Names and Units
</A></H3>
<P>
      There are two ways to tell SNOBOL4 what file will be used with
    a particular unit number:
<OL>
      <LI>As an option on the SNOBOL4 command line, like this:
<PRE>
    B&gt;SNOBOL4 PROGRAM /2=ADDRESS.TXT /8=RESULT.DAT
</PRE>
         Here, unit number 2 is associated with the file named
         'ADDRESS.TXT', and unit number 8 with file 'RESULT.DAT'.  It
         will still be necessary to use the INPUT or OUTPUT function
         described below to associate variables with these unit numbers.
     This method works best when different files will be
         used each time the program is run.
<P>
      <LI>Use a string containing the file name as the fourth argument
         to the INPUT or OUTPUT function, as in:
<PRE>
    INPUT(..., 2, ..., 'ADDRESS.TXT')
</PRE>
         This method is better when the file name will not change, or
         is a string derived from a dialogue with the user, or is
         produced from a string calculation.
<P>
         A file name consisting of a single hyphen (&quot;-&quot;) is reserved,
         and specifies the MS-DOS standard input file when used with
         the INPUT function, or the standard output file when used
         with the OUTPUT function.  These standard input or output
         files may be redirected on the command line using the MS-DOS
         redirection operators (&quot;&lt;filename&quot; and &quot;&gt;filename&quot;).
</OL><P>

<H3><A NAME="3.1.2">
    3.1.2 Input
</A></H3>
<P>
      This function associates a variable with data read from a file:
<PRE>
    INPUT('variable', unit, length, 'file')
</PRE>
      It succeeds and returns the null string if the file was found
    and successfully opened, and fails otherwise.  Length is an
    optional integer that specifies the line length.  If the file
    name argument is omitted, SNOBOL4 consults the command line to
    find the file to use with this unit.
<P>
      For example, to open file TEXT.IN for input as unit 1, and associate
    variable READLINE with it, we would say
<PRE>
            INPUT('READLINE', 1, , 'TEXT.IN')    :S(OK)
            OUTPUT = 'Could not find file'       :(END)
    OK       . . .
</PRE>
      If the file name were specified on the command line as
    /1=TEXT.IN, we only need the first two arguments to INPUT:
<PRE>
            INPUT('READLINE', 1)            :S(OK)
            OUTPUT = 'Could not find file'  :(END)
    OK       . . .
</PRE>
      To read a line from the file, we simply use READLINE in a
    statement.  The statement fails when the End-of-File is read:
<PRE>
    LINE = READLINE                 :F(END.OF.FILE)
</PRE>
      Each file-associated variable will have a line length associated
    with it (80 characters unless SNOBOL4 is told otherwise in
    the length argument).  Normally, reading stops at each end-ofline
    character (carriage return).  If more than the line length
    has been read, the extra characters are discarded.  If a short
    line is encountered, SNOBOL4 pads the line with blanks to produce
    the full line length.  The end-of-line character is not included
    in the string returned.
<P>
      Blank padding is another historic feature from the days when
    most input was on punch cards.  The next section, &quot;Keywords,&quot;
    will show you how to disable it.  You can also use the TRIM function
    to remove superfluous trailing blanks.  The previous statement
    then becomes:
<PRE>
    LINE = TRIM(READLINE)      :F(END.OF.FILE)
</PRE>
      When READLINE encounters the End-of-File, its failure signal is
    propagated outward, causing function TRIM to fail.  This failure
    is detected in the GOTO field in the usual manner.
<H3><A NAME="3.1.3">
    3.1.3 Output
</A></H3>
<P>
      This function associates a variable with data written to a
    file.  If the file does not exist, it is created.  If it already
    exists, its previous contents are discarded.
<PRE>
    OUTPUT('variable', unit, length, 'file')
</PRE>
      The function succeeds and returns the null string if the file
    was successfully opened for output, and fails otherwise.
<P>
      We write data to the file by assigning it to the associated
    variable.  In this example, we will use a variable called PRINT,
    and the DOS device PRN: with a line length of 132 characters:
<PRE>
   OUTPUT('PRINT', 2, 132, 'PRN:')   :S(PRTOK)
   OUTPUT = 'Could not attach printer'  :(END)
   PRINT  = 'Text Listing - ' DATE()
   . . .
</PRE>
      If the string assigned to an output variable is longer than the
    line length, SNOBOL4 will output as many lines as necessary of
    the standard line length to accommodate the string.  SNOBOL4 supplies
    the carriage return and line feed characters at the end of
    each line.
<P>
      Once again, the output file name could be given on the command
    line (/2=PRN:).  The function call would then look like this:
<PRE>
   OUTPUT('PRINT', 2, 132)           :S(PRTOK)
    . . .
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="3.1.4">
    3.1.4 Changing I/O Defaults
</A></H3>
<P>
      Having INPUT and OUTPUT associated with the keyboard and screen
    may be altered in the SNOBOL4 command line.  A surprising number
    of programs can be written this way, using only the variables
    INPUT and OUTPUT for I/O.  The command line phrase /I=FILENAME,
    associates INPUT with the named file, and /O=FILENAME does the
    same for OUTPUT.  SNOBOL4 makes all the associations for you; no
    call to the INPUT or OUTPUT function is required.
<P>
      SNOBOL4 also provides the pre-associated variable SCREEN.
    Using SCREEN allows your program to post messages to the display
    even if OUTPUT has been redirected elsewhere.
<P>
      If we have a program written in terms of variables INPUT and
    OUTPUT, it can be run without alteration with different data
    files.  For example, the following program will copy INPUT to
    OUTPUT, and place the line length and a blank in front of each
    line:
<PRE>
    LOOP    S = TRIM(INPUT)                 :F(END)
            OUTPUT = SIZE(S) ' ' S          :(LOOP)
    END
</PRE>
      Suppose we associate file TEXT.IN with INPUT, and TEXT.OUT with
    OUTPUT.  We've supplied the morning song from Shakespeare's
    Cymbeline in file TEXT.IN, and the program above in file
    LENGTH.SNO.  You can run it like this:
<PRE>
   B&gt;SNOBOL4 LENGTH /I=TEXT.IN /O=TEXT.OUT

   Vanilla SNOBOL4      Version 2.14.
   (c) Copyright 1984,1988 Catspaw, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

   No errors

   B&gt;TYPE TEXT.OUT
   44 Hark! hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
    . . .
</PRE>
      SNOBOL4 will supply the default file name extensions .IN and
    .OUT for the /I and /O options, so the command line could be
    shortened to:
<PRE>
    B&gt;SNOBOL4 LENGTH /I=TEXT /O=TEXT
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="3.2">
                              3.2 KEYWORDS
</A></H3>
<P>
      Input/Output allows your program to communicate with the outside
    world.  Your program may also communicate with the SNOBOL4
    system itself.  Keywords allow you to modify SNOBOL4's behavior,
    and to obtain information from the system.  A keyword consists of
    the ampersand character (&amp;) followed by an alphabetic name.  They
    are used in a statement in the same way as a variable.  They
    either provide values or have values assigned to them.  Numeric
    keywords are restricted to integer values.
<UL>
    <LI><B>&amp;TRIM</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Remove trailing blanks
<P>
      Normally, short lines read from a file are padded with blank
    characters to the standard line length.  In LENGTH.SNO, we used
    the function TRIM(INPUT) to remove those blanks.  A simpler
    method assigns an integer value to keyword &amp;TRIM to control
    padding.  If &amp;TRIM is set to a nonzero value, blanks are not
    appended, and any trailing blanks are removed.  A statement to do
    this looks like this:
<PRE>
    &amp;TRIM = 1
</PRE>
      Since trailing blanks are usually not desired, you'll often see
    this statement at the beginning of many SNOBOL4 programs.
<P>
    <LI><B>&amp;MAXLNGTH</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Maximum string length
<P>
      This keyword controls the maximum permissible string length.
    Its initial value is 5000, but it may be set to any positive
    integer from 0 to 32767.  Setting it to 0 is going to severly restrict
    what you can do, since only the null string will be available
    to you!
<P>
    <LI><B>&amp;DUMP</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Termination dump of variables
<P>
      This keyword is useful for debugging programs because it tells
    SNOBOL4 to display the values of your variables when your program
    terminates.  Setting &amp;DUMP to a positive, nonzero integer causes
    the variable names to be sorted alphabetically.  A negative integer
    produces a unsorted dump.  Zero is the default value, inhibiting
    the dump.  Only variables with nonnull values are displayed.
<P>
    <LI><B>&amp;ALPHABET</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Complete character set
<P>
      This keyword contains a 256 character string, the computer's
    entire character set in ascending sequence.  It is called a protected
    keyword because it cannot be modified by your program.
<P>
    <LI><B>&amp;LCASE</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lower case letters
<P>
      This keyword contains the 26 lower case alphabetic characters,
    &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;.
<P>
    <LI><B>&amp;UCASE</B>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Upper case letters
<P>
      This keyword contains the 26 upper case alphabetic characters,
    &quot;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;.
</UL><P>

<H3><A NAME="3.3">
                  3.3 PROGRAMS WITHOUT PATTERN MATCHING
</A></H3>
<P>
      You now have the ingredients to create some simple programs.
    However, if this were all of the SNOBOL4 language, there would be
    very little reason to use it.  We'll get to pattern matching
    shortly, where you'll find many new, challenging concepts.
    First, however, you should be comfortable with the preceding
    material.
<P>
      Take a few minutes to examine and run the following programs.
<H3><A NAME="3.3.1">
    3.3.1 File Counts - FCOUNTS.SNO
</A></H3>
<P>
      This program counts the number of characters and lines in a
    file.  Because real numbers are not available in Vanilla SNOBOL4,
    you should only use this program with input files smaller than
    32,767 characters.
<PRE>
            &amp;TRIM  = 1
            CHARS  = 0
    NEXTL   CHARS  = CHARS + SIZE(INPUT)    :F(DONE)
            LINES  = LINES + 1              :(NEXTL)
    DONE    OUTPUT = CHARS ' characters'
            OUTPUT = +LINES ' lines read'
    END
</PRE>
      In such a small program, it's permissible to rely upon the fact
    that the system initializes LINES to the null string.  The first
    use of the statement:
<PRE>
    LINES  = LINES + 1              :(NEXTL)
</PRE>
    converts LINES from the null string to an integer value.  We used
    the expression +LINES in the last statement to produce an integer
    0 (instead of the null string), if the input file were empty.  To
    count the characters and lines in a file, use the /I= option, as
    in:
<PRE>
    B&gt;SNOBOL4 FCOUNTS.SNO /I=TEXT.IN
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="3.3.2">
    3.3.2 Formatting Text - TRIPLET.SNO
</A></H3>
<P>
      This program reformats a file by centering the lines and arranging
    them in groups of three.  Note that statements containing
    an asterisk in column one are considered comments by SNOBOL4.
<PRE>
    * Trim input, count input lines:
            &amp;TRIM = 1
            N = 0

    * Read next input line, all done if End-of-File.
    LOOP    S = INPUT                       :F(END)

    * Precede with blanks to center within 80 character line:
            OUTPUT = DUPL(' ', (80 - SIZE(S)) / 2) S

    * Increment count, but reset to 0 every third line.
    * Also, output a blank line when count resets:
            N = REMDR(N + 1, 3)
            OUTPUT = EQ(N, 0)               :(LOOP)
    END
</PRE>
      This program uses the DUPL function to produce the leading
    blanks required to center a line.  A simple calculation based on
    each line's width determines the number of blanks needed.
<P>
      The last two statements break the file lines into triplets.
    The REMDR function returns the integer remainder (modulus) when
    the first argument is divided by the second.  In this case,
    assigning the result to variable N causes N to continually cycle
    through the values 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, ....  When N is 0, the last
    statement assigns the null string to OUTPUT, producing a blank
    line.  If N is 1 or 2, EQ fails, and the assignment fails.
<P>
      Try running the program with the sample text file:
<PRE>
    B&gt;SNOBOL4 TRIPLET /I=TEXT
</PRE>
